@InasAhmed16 We think they are tidally locked to their host star, which means they would have permanent night/day sides.
@norgrove_c The TRAPPIST-1 system is about 40 light-years from Earth.
@ingermann_ Yes, these planets are tidally locked.
@braydenx2 The first planet in the TRAPPIST-1 system was detected in 2013.
@AlineUrbiola The next step is continued study of the TRAPPIST-1 system with @NASA_Hubble, @NASAspitzer, @NASAKepler and soon @NASAWebb
@ReviewMathUSA @lizlandau The TRAPPIST-1 star and the 7 planets orbiting it are at least 500 million years old.
@plannopoetico The TRAPPIST-1 star and; the 7 planets orbiting it are at least 500 million years old. TRAPPIST-1A, the star, does burn hydrogen
@RyanBeverley We still don't know about the presence of planets further out in the solar system. We'll have to continue our observations.
@ashren The @NASAWebb will provide higher resolution information about the planet's atmospheres.
@DdoubleJ_OB We could probe this system using space-based telescopes in our solar system, like we doing now with @NASA_Hubble and others.
@joestandman The planets are quite close to their star. For perspective, all 7 would fit within the orbit of Mercury in our solar system.
@tonedspark The TRAPPIST-1 star and its planets are a minimum of 500 million years old.
@EireBen All of them could potentially harbor water. Stay tuned for updates from @NASA_Hubble and; @NASAWebb for more on this.
@Daveton03 Their orbital periods determine whether the planet is inside the habitable zone.
@rbrXlarabee We don't know yet! Stay tuned for further findings from @NASA_Hubble and @NASAWebb
@kb7zrb Probably constant. Given their orbital configuration, it seems unlikely that they would have seasons.
@ebonyavajohnson It would be like seeing the features you're able to view on our moon from Earth! Pretty neat!
@19SkyBlue87 This system is located about 40 light-years from Earth. Not sure about Buzz Lightyear though!
@TheAnaMk To study the basics of these planets, like their size and; atmospheres, we don't need to compensate for the 40 year light difference.
@pibyte Not at this time, but perhaps with better and longer observation with newer telescopes like @NASAWebb telescope
@WilliamShatner Right now we've only confirmed the 7, but we are looking for more using @NASAspitzer and @NASAKepler!
@DylanDeeble There will be other systems more amenable to "images". For these a few years before seeing their atmospheres another way.
@yurii2710 None that we know of. Their years span from 1 - 20 days.

@djankov (3/3) Gravity makes all the geology possible - tidal activity.
@djankov (2/3) The magnetic field doesn cause the plumes but it is why we could determine the previous ones.
@djankov (1/3) All of Europa geology made possible by tides on it, because of Jupiter gravitational fields.
@SciFiGeneration What we want to confirm is habitability first, before we take the next step, which is landing.
@Tore_Aurstad (2/2)At least 1 of Europa plumes is equatorial-none seen so far are on south pole. All higher latitudes, unlike Enceladus.
@Tore_Aurstad (1/2) Yes, coincidence. Enceladus: only area with interesting geology is south pole. Europa: It's everywhere.
@SpacetimeLabs The discovery of plumes doesn't change priorities for Europa mission, it validates them. Helps us ask different questions.
@alex_andrade7_m Congress directed NASA to begin studies of lander mission to launch in 2024. We're assessing feasibility of that direction
@JPMajor None so far - the only thing that we know is that Europa has an oxygen exosphere.
@ckawohl We officially decided in favor of the Europa flyby mission. The launch date we currently working toward is 2022.
@ashren - @NASAWebb will have a different view of Europa - observing it in the infrared. The signature of water would be seen differently.
@KJansky It possible but it not the leading model - that is one of the models that been proposed.
@GalileoMoon Europa flyby mission will look at the habitability. The next question for a future mission would be to search for life.

@uhnoneemus We don know for certain if these plumes are there yet. If so, a mixture of ice crystals and vapor is the most likely.
@waynoo1 Congress has directed NASA to begin studies of a lander mission to launch in 2024. We're assessing feasibility of that direction.
@ThinkAvatarRI There's an ongoing scientific debate as to how we go about finding life. Will determine instruments sent on future missions.
@RoryStoves We don know - possibly tectonics caused by tides and; other stresses on Europa. Hope to find out someday.
@grunzwanzling42 We want to protect from contamination. If we get to sample, want to know it is from Europa and; not something brought with us
@subodhdeshpand4 Probably has similar starting ingredients to Earth--ice, water, rock--but we don have any proof that life is there.
@henrygeenature Yes,  certain as we can be without swimming there. Magnetosphere measurements from Galileo tell us the ocean is there.
@tsamolotoff - @NASAJuno has powerful instruments on it, but we want to avoid contaminating Europa, so Juno orbit won go near Europa.
@SakavJagam Europa is outside of the  zone in our solar system but certainly has liquid water inside it - it a special case

@NYCstreetchat Depends on the orbit for @NASAJuno . The first 2 orbits are 53.5 days, then the subsequent science orbits will be 14 days.
@astroryn The one-way travel time of the signal from @NASAJuno to Earth is 48 mins. Everything received on Earth was sent 48 mins earlier
@mmaltaisLA The @NASAJuno spacecraft has a carefully planned course to get into orbit around Jupiter. It's designed to avoid known objects
@sikkasb - @NASAJuno looks at Jupiter's origins, interior structure, deep atmosphere and; magnetosphere to better understand the planet
@begraffic - @NASAJuno's power is electric, but it also has hydrazine engines to help adjust its course
@KW2P All the times for @NASAJuno are Earth-receive time. Spacecraft events happen 48 mins earlier. One-way signal takes 48 mins tonight.
@DeSocorr Science orbits for @NASAJuno take 14 days and; come in as close as 2600 miles above the clouds of Jupiter to skirt radiation belts
@BoemMadi It's an interesting part of the mission. @NASAJuno will explore the atmosphere of Jupiter, including the Great Red Spot
@HashTagMaan The @NASAJuno spacecraft will turn for going into orbit, burn its engine, thenreorient itself towards the sun to get power
@f3rmion Jupiter was likely the first planet to form and; its formation had influence on the rest of our solar system forming - including Earth
@TheMidasMichael - @NASAJuno looks at Jupiter's origins, interior structure, deep atmosphere and; magnetosphere to better understand the planet
@anna_brehmer - @NASAJuno looks at Jupiter's origins, interior structure, deep atmosphere and; magnetosphere to better understand the planet
@TDunlop0 The @NASAJuno spacecraft will fly inside the orbits of Jupiter's moons and as close to Jupiter as 2600 miles about the clouds
@DlORTEARS The @NASAJuno spacecraft will investigate Jupiter beneath the clouds. We hope to discover more information about the interior.
@johnlangen Not fix it, but @NASAJuno will explore the great Red Spot, particularly how deep it goes into the atmosphere. Stay tuned!
@Cygnusx112 @NASASocial @NASAJPL The one-way travel time is 48 mins each way.

@lasusong You're welcome, but we really can't take all the credit. It was evolution who did all the work.
@Heavens_2BETSY This was not our fault. I am certain of that.
@sashaafed We are an academic journal, so we take all questions seriously. You saw this because of light detection in your retina.
@lungsintar We are much better at publishing leading edge science as compared to controlling the weather...
@jsrosenblum Good catch; not sure how that made it past the sub-editors...
@SoskaCream @Elendol We're glad you read and enjoyed our editorial.
@SarahNEmerson You may not want to read the editorial then...too traumatic. Here, we'll summarize: Such research requires rigorous scrutiny.
@brembs Fixing academia or scientific dissemination does not require the closing of inst or journals. The public can decide on alternatives.
@janadelkay Here let me fix that for you: #nature #dirt #leaves
@allywtvr Our control of the weather is surprisingly limited.
@Emulate_Me You didn't like our latest issue? :(
@rmounce @theWinnower We don't forbid signed reviews. Our physics refs do it all the time. It's a community thing and; bio does not favor it.
@theWinnower @rmounce At least a subset of the original refs are used, depending on required expertise. New refs are recruited as needed.

@mmaxinelucille Wow, it's been a while since we've been referred to as someone's "homie."
@TarunaIkrar Perhaps we missed something. Is this citation in response to something we mentioned here?
@IAmTracyBrown We're pretty sure that scene was created by light diffraction and; many other explainable scientific phenomena.

@moorehn Thank you for your welcome advice. Have a pleasant day.
@moorehn You're arguing something else. I was simply remarking it's quite difficult to confuse @nature on Twitter with @nature on Instagram.
@mathiasdisney Not really. The news team (who wrote the blog post) and manuscript editors are independently-run teams, as it should be.
@moorehn Actually there couldn't be more of a difference between a 145-year-old scientific journal and an Instagram photo account.
@PubPeer @ivanoransky As usual, we will comment on any and all corrections/retractions once all reports/investigations are final.
@VirginieKeller1 @MalikoTanguy If you refer to a lack of mention for computational/modeling datasets, perhaps @ScientificData can comment.

@JaniKris3 Humans cutting down the rainforest make us angry as well. However, more can be done through action and donations than twitter.
@tightxxguy You should consider posting this on Instagram, you know, where there is an account using our name searching for photos..
.@JPDelehanty We're not on Instagram, but despite taking our 145-year-old name, we do respect that acct as 1 of the few who sources photos.
@theglobejumpers It's not that mysterious. Certain lava contains an abundance of green olivine crystals that are turned into sand by waves.
@BodyFit101 apologies but you mistaken us for a photo account. But if you want to appreciate the science behind nature, consider staying!
@toolhandluke I have no idea what you talking about and that okay.
@MCBrophris Anything other than Taraxacum officinale ;)
@MCBrophris We aren't associated with that Instagram account, we are a scientific journal. And actually, that's a dandelion, not a wildflower.

@academigod @theWinnower Indeed. Our OA journals charge APCs. And our non-OA journals offer subscriptions. You getting the hang of this!
@HokkaidoOlaf Now you confusing sex with gender. Animals in pre-clinical studies do not have a gender, they have a sex.
@HokkaidoOlaf It is a fact that some drugs and; bio mechanisms work differently in males and; females. These sex diffs need to be better-studied.
@Kebechet2 thank you for endorsing our existence.
@dietcoke676 We do not sell beet capsules, but glad you are treating your high blood pressure.
@harlekeinn Afraid we didn follow your reference. The 3rd part of the holy trinity is usually the Holy Spirit, not our venerable journal.
@estahp Fascinating. Are you having a reaction to reading our magazine? Please be safe.
@theWinnower @academigod It not complicated at all. More than half of our research output is OA right now. And that is trending upwards.
@bhuchungtsering ahh, my mistake! I meant to click  to the tweet above yours in my mentions. Glad you enjoyed the article!
@McJock Ones that live in Russia and; Scandanavia are. They travel to South Europe or North Africa. Britain population are largely resident.
ALERT: Several links to content in our current issue are broken. We're working on it and many apologies for any inconveniences.
@dhimmel @carlystrasser The Australian taxpayer funds his research. This was not a research paper. Thanks for your time.
@dhimmel @carlystrasser This was produced like a book review or column. Based on your definition of OA, The Economist should be open-access.
@SusnnGnzlz Beautiful image. Glad you feel so strongly. Which of our journals is your favorite to read on the beach?
@SamuelPEAN @carlystrasser Apologies, but this was corr to the eds, part of our front-half content. Like book reviews. Not basic research.
@davindersembhi This sounds lovely, but I believe you would have better luck contacting a horticulturist, not a scientific journal.
@breetneyjordan @rindseyray Many apologies for this tragedy, however I can assure you we weren't in the area when it started. Pls stay safe.
@healydanes1975 Now, now. Just tell us what's wrong. Are you trying to submit a manuscript?
@theWinnower I'm not sure cherry-picking a single data pt in time defines commitment or applied strategy change. Thanks for noticing though.
@theWinnower For NPG, over half seems committed, yes. We publish 800-900 papers a year. NPG publishes &gt;21,000.
.@theWinnower We're proud that 51% of NPG's research pub output was open-access in 2013 and; that &gt;60% of our journs have OA options or are OA.
@elliotpage @mattjhodgkinson your tweet was attached to the original. Like all threaded @-replies. Apologies for understanding twitter.
@mattjhodgkinson @Protohedgehog 3. Those who think we're @nature from Instagram. These ones irritate me most b/c they're phishing for an RT.
@mattjhodgkinson @Protohedgehog 3 defined types:n1. Those who think @'s are hashtagsn2. Those who use @'s regardless of who has the handle
@mattjhodgkinson just having a bit of fun with the lovely twitter hoards.
@elliotpage @mattjhodgkinson I beg to differ...taking it seriously would involve no replies at all...
@carlystrasser Open-access typically refers to primary research papers and data. This is correspondence to the editors.
@PubPeer @rmounce I'm not saying PubPeer is invalid as a requestor, but we also can't expect culture to change overnight.
@PubPeer @rmounce My fear is authors won't reply to messages from a PubPeer address. I would recommend the "Peer" contact auths directly.
@TheHalfAfrican Many condolences for your loss, but we are not responsible for the disruption of your satellite service. Hope your team won.
@AngsanaSeeds These are not our images. You may want to check the accounts you mention in your tweets.
@pena_albert Apologies but we are a science journal, not the masters of your weather.
@rmounce @PubPeer @GrrlScientist Not sure why you refer to it as a bluff. Readers simply need to contact the corresponding author.
@yoh_tanimoto At this site, all papers are initially posted as pre-prints. I see that over the weekend, one referee has now signed off.
@yoh_tanimoto The investigation into the validity of the papers is ongoing. And the replication is a pre-print, not peer-reviewed yet.
@AnthonyGabay @RichJoules As the editors note on this paper states, this was reviewed by an anonymous ref and; was revised before publication.
@DoctahHu Apologies, but we do not control the weather.
@horanpride @Rain @thunder @weather Such strong language. We recommend using hashtags in the future rather than @-symbols.
@Pa7rinity Actually science says trees are critical to establishing the oxygen-based atmosphere that has supported life for millions of yrs.
@Pa7rinity We cannot agree with this statement. Many apologies.
@queenjbeean @sky @god Apologies but we have no control over the rain.
@angeline7499 @selfie @vacation I think you wanted to use hashtags here. Those would be infinitely more effective in classification.
@amselcom We didn't take this picture. Check your local listings and please try again.
@MichaelMonago Thank you, but I believe this tweet might have been for the Earth and not our magazine.
@missdavies_ @ShonePatrol There is no smoking allowed in our offices, so I do not believe we provided this space. Many apologies.
@theonlyabbyhere We don't control vast armies of moths so this was not our doing. Many apologies.
@omesan_nair If @voguemagazine is the premiere magazine within its discipline, then yes, we agree.
@J_Liptak If you have a personal or institutional subscription, simply login. @readcube is a means by which to rent/purchase a single PDF.
@caseybergman @sjurdur It's more than just Twitter. It's based on all data from @altmetric.
@DJGrothe @Calvyn82 @sciam @AEI We understand. Hence the point of covering it in our own way, focusing more on the science and; disparity.
@NatRevNeurosci: New Highlight: mTORC1 inhibitor REDD1 is essential for stress-induced synapse loss and depression-like behaviour ():ht
@baccivorous so sorry to hear that. Perhaps, instead of dealing with living things, try reading our very safe, sanitary articles?
@JBYoder Hi, that wasa @SciAm news story re-posted on @NatureNews. This account handles the actual research.
@PepPamies whoops. Yes, we should re-post the hi res. thanks for the catch.
@RonanTKavanagh @nuigalway We don't actually publish clinical work, but wish the new journal well.
@HCDayantis well, that is how we do it for all our branding...
Hey twttr, how do you like the new look of our handle?
@Protohedgehog That's not what I hear "in the field." What you say will be true when hiring/tenure committees count preprints as precedence.
@Protohedgehog I should correct the previous tweet -- *Biologists* (on average) are not prepared to post preprints b/c of competitive fears.
@Protohedgehog Mandating preprint submission would cause a massive cessation of submissions. Scientists are simply not ready for this shift.
@Protohedgehog You must not be familiar with pre-prints. By def they're non-peer-reviewed. And we appreciate your admiration for our product.
@Protohedgehog Therefore, every researcher in any field already has a tool to speed up science that they fail to use. So blaming is complex.
@Protohedgehog Every paper submitted to us can be posted on a pre-print server at the time of submission witho any influence on our decisions.
@Protohedgehog We're a privately-owned company with &gt;40% of our titles either OA or hybrid. We're part of HINARI and; OAI. We're always evolving.
@Protohedgehog Since most major funding agencies are satisfied with a 1yr embargo period based on their data, we simply bested that by half.
@tollkuhn I don't understand your question, but would be happy to clarify for you. Could you provide more details on the confusion?
@mikemadowitz @JustinWolfers This isn't an actual research paper. It's only a correspondence to the editors with a table. Not peer-reviewed.
@Protohedgehog @NatureNews For many of the largest (like NIH) we do it for authors. The 6mo policy is also 1/2 time of most OA requirements.
@Protohedgehog @NatureNews This is irrelevant b/c we encourage all authors to archive the final non-production version of papers after 6mos.
@acleyns50 @NatureNews Internally, we update our records of authors and reviewers as needed. We do not update contact info for papers.
@fMRI_guy @MLBrook Such is the Nature of the world in which we live...
@MLBrook: 1 spider (of many) down. Brutally murdered by a rolled up copy of @NatureMagazine
@jwoodgett @GholsonLyon They're not advertorials. Nature Publishing Group retains sole responsibility for editorial content.
@GholsonLyon @jwoodgett I strongly suggest you write to Herb Brody (h.brody@us.nature.com) to voice concerns so we can correct inaccuracies.
@GholsonLyon @jwoodgett We were unaware that these clearly-labeled sponsored supplements were being confused for peer-reviewed primary sci.
@GholsonLyon @jwoodgett Actually, keeping them separate is the only way to go.
@GholsonLyon Please don't confuse our Outlooks supplements for academic reviews. They are mostly written by journalists for the gen public.

@Montisumosc2 I would recommend discussing this with your institutional librarian so everyone is using the same definition for "publish."
@Montisumosc2 If it's unpublished thesis data, it is treated the same as any unpublished data -- meaning it is fine to publish.

@sennoma Hi Bill, thanks for noticing the oversight. The response to the correspondence is being placed in front of the paywall. Cheers. &gt;NG
@Ananyo: On that letter. The matter is being investigated -urgently- and senior editors are aware of the reaction it has prompted.
@salajlan @OAforClimate Another option: rent it through @readcube for ~ $3.99 (not sure which paper to which you are referring) on our site.
@Protohedgehog As a human endeavor, mistakes can be made by authors, editors and; refs. We're glad our papers are read, so mistakes are caught.
@Protohedgehog ...And we'll continue to retract them as they are discovered.
@lirarandall @NaturePhysics Sorry to keep passing down, but it certainly sounds like @NatureNews is the relevant party here!

@CAPChrisTrott @cstampeen Alamo was founded in 1997, I guess that qualifies as antique in the US  - I'm just glad US is moving forward.
Looks like they're having trouble moving scenery into place. At least their star isn't trapped inside a pyramid (this really happened).
@cstampeen California is a very progressive state.
@cstampeen cinema... airports deal with travelers from all over the world with higher expectations of alcohol availability.
I do wish the bar was open, but I guess there's not normally any demand at 11:30am
While the video feed isn't as cool as being there, on the upside we get to see what's going on behind the scenes during the intermission.
@acuriouskey your 'imagining' shows your prejudice, it's not a 'hipster' thing, it's a 'good phone' thing.
Watching the audience at the Met in NYC and they're all taking selfies. Every single one has an iPhone. Opera fans aren't android users....
@IbeauRenoir @alikchialeika true, I wonder what @llamasoft_ox makes of camel cannons
It's half be hour before this live opera event starts and all the good seats are already taken. Old people get up early it seems.
Going to be going to see the Opera first thing this morning, part of Skye's school work on music appreciation.
@Kamik423 looks like @SPACEdotcom don't have the budget to hire writers who remember their rocket history.
Actually now I think about it, the person best positioned to model rotating roller coasters in space is @DavidBraben
@elonmusk Ever considered building a coaster in space, rotating coriolis and; centripetal force instead of a boring linear gravity field.
@donttrythis sometimes you don't need to blow things up to bust the most important myths.
I wonder whether @donttrythis ever had problems with people unfollowing because he busted myths that people wanted to be true.
@bearmccreary @edwardjolmos Congratulations.... By coincidence was listening to BSG music right now.
@snoblitz dang, how will victims ever undock if the node is down?
@Google: On this day in 1967, British astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered the first pulsars, proving the existence of neutron
@xZise yep any long lived SCM will have lots of references to old hashes outside repo, changing can be hard.
@xZise but there are problems with historical hashes to figure out too.
@SebastianDubke @vexaurora it's an example of confirmation bias.
@dmday3000 after I clear my giant backlog of other things.
@vexaurora Video is terrible, but would you prefer someone explaining it?
@TonyGreyfox More hilarious sarcasm from @AndrewCFollett who's uncritically retweeted 23 articles from @DailyCaller in the last week.
@HighContrast @MTVUK Ever thought of doing a 'Back to Mine' style compilation since your musical expertise goes far beyond the dancefloor?
@TonyGreyfox you see @AndrewCFollett has confirmed we should read any similarly phrased tweets from @DailyCaller as sarcastic humor.
@AndrewCFollett @TonyGreyfox come on guys, he said it was sarcasm. It should be obvious from the context and structure of the tweet.
@TonyGreyfox @Kingdomcub I've always said sarcasm is not something that the US does well.
@arstechnica latest episode certainly took the show's habit of stretching the laws of physics well past breaking point.
@twostepsonward does it do SCE to AUX????? Also, how does that work with Orbiter 2016?
@twostepsonward: @DJSnM We have finally released Project Apollo - NASSP 7.0 for Orbiter 2010! I know you talked about it in the past: ht
@Mattophobia I noticed that there's no set which includes Alfred in his crime fighting outfit.
@AidanOrf orbital periods are all small odd integer fractions, so very likely to be stable in long term.
@chipsalz sounds like Fran Chau has merged with Jules-Pierre Mao.
@howellspace: Folks, as of March 31 I won't be working for @Seeker for the foreseeable future. (Layoffs.) If anyone needs science or spa
@rjcroyTellif we find an F type star with 7 planets, that'd be an even better candidate for @neiltyson idea.
@ItAintNoMan did you mean to tell me this before I posted a video on it?
@VJRanda Red Dwarf is a main sequence star, in fact TRAPPIST-1 is expected to be a main sequence star for 5 Trillion years.
@GavinMSchofield @neiltyson Snow White 2018 (Special Edition) - Now with even more dwarves (and more merchandising opportunities!).
@neiltyson a year ago it had 2 known planets, no guarantee the discoveries will stop at 7.
Thanks to @UniverseSandbox and @SpaceEngineSim for the tools used to visualize TRAPPIST-1
@astro_kimbrough: So glad to have @SpaceX #Dragon aboard the @Space_Station! She brought us over 2 tons of science, hardware, and suppli
@AndrewCFollett Would have been a fine headline in The Onion. Like my comments about the greatest expansion in brewerys under Obama.
@AndrewCFollett Should probably have made more effort to call out those mistakes then rather than confirming bias via omission.
@AndrewCFollett n1. Pluto redesignated a Dwarf Planet in 2006n2. &gt;1200 Exoplanets discovered during Obama's term - including these 7.n#fails
@NapoClown Alumina, which is transparent at normal pressures.
@legotex9 nah, I'm just guilt of knowing things like 'science'
@ArcticPheenix Just got sent a key, will consider it after I clear my enormous backlog.
@hankgreen you'll find that as your little one learns to speak one of the last things they'll learn is the difference between 't' and 'c'.
@ManMadeMoon: I did forget one little bit of the speech though....nFuck cancer.nFuck it right off the planet.
@LeeBillings @nyrath @SFKissinger does the data rule out moons large enough to have parent planets locked to them instead?
@RAFRed10: *Hums Europe's 'The Final Countdown'* Only 500 votes left for the magic 10,000 and; LEGO will review the model (then we'll stop
@TheDerpyDon Not bad at all, impressive engineering and all that.
@NASASpaceflight shame we can't see more shock diamonds, the RS-25 produces really good ones because of its expansion ratio.
@llamasoft_ox Doesn't DCS support VR - that's free on steam.
@monxas I know I could get closer with some F5/F9 action.
@inocuae I also have a fundraising dinner to attend tonight.
@inocuae It's not like I had a warning ahead of time. I'm at work and won't be able to do anything until I'm home.
@mielkman @EliteDangerous Why not it's an M8V which is a main sequence red dwarf rather than a brown dwarf.
The star the newly discovered exoplanets are orbiting is only 0.08 Solar masses, potential lifetime of over a trillion years.
@astVintageSpace Is that the one on display at Meteor crater?
@ThatDearGuy oh I know all about that, back then I was disassembling bitmap brothers games to look at sprite implementation.
@workahol final showdown on the moon on with a cannon launched dropship.
@BigWhale sure you'd have trains, but later in the game you'd recruit Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin
@ZeForgotten yes, he'd be comic relief, until they get some me alien tech and Edison is the one who finished fires out how to copy it.
@DJSnM Tesla would create lightning guns, Marie Curie would have radiation bombs, and Edison would be very good at copying alien's gear.
@RuiApostolo i can't it would clash with my day job.
If I had time and money I'd make a steampunk XCOM featuring famous scientists from ~1900. Each developing their own special gear.
@Mattophobia even at my level it only makes sense as a hobby
@MikeHobsonEsq except for Apple going to great lengths to make your private data private so that even they can't read it.
@dsaccardi @nyrath @SpaceX @qz @TimFernholz that's a lot more reliable than saving and reloading until I hit the target.
@EclecticMethod: Remix @Avengers @Marvel @RobertDowneyJr @ChrisEvans @chrishemsworth @MarkRuffalo @renner4real @twhiddleston @SamuelLJac
@IanPopp @drewscanlon I'm sure it's because a situation that dire doesn't come along often. When the time comes, they know where to find me.
@TehAutismGamer that's the Grubb, I used it, not so much work, but I showed people Hale Bopp. My office was right next to that dome.
@LetYourLifeBe @sicariozzz @ExpanseSyfy @nyrath @Syfy good news is... I've done the math on that in the past :)
@drewscanlon I hope this is nothing to do with me and my coworkers making you move to the first floor.
@NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF I think KSP players know the technical side, but they don't know the specific ISS rendezvous protocol and; lingo.
@xZise @NuclearDiner @thedrive @wordpressdotcom Yeah I figured it wasn't a test given that it's very specific to one isotope.
@NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF I think I have a new video idea.... explaining CE and; HA burns (KSP players don't follow well planned rendezvous).
@planetlabs I'm going to hazard a guess and say that photo wasn't taken this weekend?
@boxmaker709 Relax it's at super low levels, but it's a signature of something.....
@ArturSowinski @arstechnica @BethMarieMole You're joking right?
@TheYunners apparently Facebook is tweeting every link for me....
@sicariozzz @ExpanseSyfy @nyrath @Syfy true, but they probably can't do that quickly, I'm sure it took years.
@sicariozzz @ExpanseSyfy @nyrath @Syfy doesn't help you much against 7trillion tons of rock.
Orion tells me the Lego Batman Movie sets have way too many not black parts.
@TristanForBC was.dong a few but got sick the last few days
@Vizhonary Oh yeah I backed it too.... I back lots of games I never play.
@SarahMthembu2 Are you calling the little known historical drama 'Independence Day' fake news? Can't deny proof like that.
@SarahMthembu2 But those interstellar travellers have been hacked by Jeff Goldblum and an Apple PowerBook - evening the odds.
Q: You and a bunch ofUS Presidentshead to the local pub quiz, who do you want on your team? #PresidentsDay
@2K @2KSupport Important Question - will we see updates to iOS version to bring them up to date for modern devices?
Next One:nQ: You're booked for America's Best Dance Crew - which presidents do you choose for your crew?
@rockdemon696 He knows that what every woman wants is a well functioning democracy?
@doug_ellison Curiosity is the richest robot on Mars.
Some fun answer so far...nQ: You're shopping for gifts for your sister in law, which president do you turn to for advice?
Q: you're making an episode of Dr Who, which president do you hire to wear the Dalek Emperor suit?
Q: Aliens have invaded, a last ditch air assault needs everyone who can fly, which president would you want leading the attack.
Q: You're planning a heist, which president is your getaway driver, who rides shotgun, and who's job is to distract the guards?
Q: Which former US president would you want with you if your tour of Jurassic Park went wrong?
@DanNerdCubed A couple of years ago the PC version of KOTOR II got a big update, because mobile had been successful.
@DanNerdCubed It mostly works, but the race scenes were really hard with touch controls.
@hankgreen and there's a transition away from analogue radio, in 100 years the sound of static may be a historical curio for most.
@DamageOnAHit @andref1989 @pecisk Yep, Von Braun's early passenger rocket concepts were designed with reuse in mind.
@DJSnM Nobody else got why it was so incredibly funny, just me an Amy laughing obnoxiously loud when everyone else was silent.
So yeah, Lego Batman movie was a hoot from start to end. But the lonely return to Batcave at the start had Amy crying with laughter.
@tsloan306 Given that they're the only people reliably doing it, It's by definition the least and most practical way to do it.
@BadAstronomer @arielwaldman @mikamckinnon So we actually have more concrete data on how open NASA was in the past.
@BadAstronomer @arielwaldman @mikamckinnonalso worth noting that NASA's long history has meant many things once kept secret are public
@arielwaldman @BadAstronomer @mikamckinnon SIlicon Valley Comic Con is in San Jose in April - not nearly as big as SD, but more convenient.
Ok, let's hope this Lego Batman movie is awesome.
@Hoddd9000 white on one side, dark solar cells on other
So... testing a new strong back retraction method on a commercial launch. SpaceX still experimenting with every launch.
KSP players who're watching the stream are now realising where the inspiration of the KSP launch pad came from.
@MikeSafyan @planetlabs @TheEconomist but their optics are pointing the wrong way!!!
@hankgreen @AccioSanity did you know Bananas are radioactive clones with triploid DNA?
@Michael_Bowyer_ 3rd victory in a row, Mantis A - now wondering whether to go for Slug A, Engi A or Lanius A
@geoffk01 @matthew_d_green sure but wild@weites rarely flip a single bit
@sgrif @Casillic It's not the yard that's the problem it's the Yard + Foot + inch + thou + line + mile + furlong + league + chain + rod
@katrobison hearing things like that is the best part of this hobby.
@katrobison I hope you only had bad things to say about me :)
@NASASpaceflight sorry I slept in and this makes me a little happy....
@dzsenits @RichardFPenn in a recent AMA they mention melting and solidifying crust..... but I also did the math on that.
@BenTherDunTht point is, mars always goes same direction around the sun, but it does a little loop when we view from earth.
@BenTherDunTht That's apparent motion, its because we're passing mars on the inside.
@BenTherDunTht You mean retrograde rotation? Or the odd retrograde asteroid? Or retrograde motion in the sky near syzygy?
@SolSystem_1 @TheExpanseWRfor the Epstein drive, needs 500 billion tons of fusion fuels and about 50trillion tonsof reaction mass.
@caranha a long time ago, I got mildly obsessed with it for a while.
@mbhnyc @TheExpanseWR you can do that on paper, problem then is how you capture that kind of angular momentum with your breaking up.
@TheDerpyDon you can engineer systems to be robust against random errors.
Rough math shows to spin up Ceres to provide 0.3g it would take thrust of 40million Saturn V's firing for 10 years. @TheExpanseWR
@TheDerpyDon it would detect and fix bit errors so yes it would.
@Aviation_Hub: Beautiful photo... The #Avro #Vulcan shadowing it's equally menacing partner in crime the #EE #Lightning @RoyalAirForce #
@wolfmanwolf45 something came down - cosmic rays. This isn't fraud, just bad hardware design. US Voter Fraud is essentially nonexistent.
@CCP_karkur That's a crime against humanity, Hawaiian pizza is the best.
@CCP_karkur Is this the same one that was asked to resign after Panama papers?
@mikerugnetta @TheCrashCourse @YouTube My son Orion will love this.
@Nurse_Bluheart well that's a @RokuPlayer problem
@mattybfj honestly, I think this is something for a person with actual engineering expertise.
Just had a crazy idea - a Lego Rocket. nnNo, not a lego model of a rocket, a hybrid rocket with lego as the fuel.
@_Sc0rpion It'll probably cause a revenue drop for channels that just turn on all ad options, but I wouldn't do that.
@MattAlbar pay for youtube red (and get a bunch of other things like music)
@HisRoyalCarlnes @subsetgames That's the shape of the iPad (4th Gen) screen
Orbital mechanics in latest episode of @ExpanseSyfy are dubious... writers should talk to @b612foundation about diverting asteroids.

@neiltyson All the smart astronomy nerds have started talking about @ExpanseSyfy
@XplodingUnicorn @awanderingjon Monopoly is legit the worst popular board game, late game dealing grinds play to a halt.

@Mynxee @RixxJavix if iMovie is pr bing too limiting the FCP is my choice on MacOS
@backstube still intact back then, but the question is whether destruction happened when expected.
@riseandhope @arstechnica @RoheeniSax data is from 1970 to 2010

@DavidBrin you haven't seen any of the questions that get hikacked by flat earther's, moon hoaxers or electric universe woo.
@EllipticGames @DanNerdCubed I remember networking through air (rather than radio) - we call them acoustic couplers.
@Gobukiller Not really, Saturn V first stage is Kerolox withF-1 engines. SLS more like a Space Shuttle without wings - same engines and fuels
@EastBaySPCA He's home now, a little the worse for wear.
@NASA @NASA_Langley I love the Saturn 1 - it's one of the more Kerbal rockets to have flow, with a 1st stage cobbled together quickly.
@DanGheesling @HaleGaming @EliteDangerous Sanitation? This isn't Space Station 13 (yet).
@hcf64 @elakdawalla @NoisyAstronomer problem is elephants are mostly water, but you could make elephant meat salami and run a hybrid rocket.
Forget the elephants, the Saturn V 1st stage generated 60 gigawatts, based on the Egon Spengler scale that's 105 kilotwinkies per second.
@ColdRice_Dev depends on how big a bomb you want to shelter from.
@EliteDangerous I have a second account, but it doesn't have beta so I won't be able to have the kids as co-pilots until the full release.
Looks like I'm going to need some collaborators to help me show off Multiplayer in the @EliteDangerousBeta. Anyone on my schedule?
@DanNerdCubed 'moron' is letting him off lightly.
@dweekly IoT is a contraction of IoTTSNBCttI - because it's too much of a mouthful.
@tychoc @wsm1 @isro That video I posted explains it, they orient solar panels to increase or decrease drag and control orbital phase.
@andyweirauthor getting into that whole youtube gaming thing? I'm sure you have a lot to say about the games based on your work.
@tychoc @wsm1 @isro @YouTube It's all about the rapid updates, a single satellite can't cover the whole earth, but a ring of small ones can.
@MikeHobsonEsq I did, any idea why it's suddenly being reposted again?
@doug_ellison @KerbalSpaceP they did it intentionally, breaking your vessel into 100 pieces accidentally is less impressive.

@TetrologyGaming @AmberEikelKTVU @KTVU I see women working on those sites when I walk by, surprised you can tell gender from that video.
@_JRobison: Rooftop crane leaning on top of 33 Tehama in #SoMa, where concrete slab has broken on under-construction building. #sanfranc
@TetrologyGaming @ibreakz2025 the concern is it could bring down crane, evac radius is based on height of crane.
@TakenaRussell @nbcbayarea you can, just credit me.
@nbcbayarea no probs with you using those with credit
@AustinOnSocial large concrete slab not sure exactly
@jesustheplumber tell that to the Astronaut Office
@Jibo92 That's actually more accurate than my model in many places.
@batslyadams @chipzel dang this is beautiful, spent my late teens hacking on 68K
@hankgreen @cenmag @BristolUni silver lining, is unlike many of the compounds I see in that blog, this won't poison you after exploding.
@ThatDearGuy only if you want to repeat things I said in the livestream
@JoyceGaming Yes, the space shuttle first launch had a crew on board. Of course the Soviet Buran didn't have a crew.
@NealShepperson Captain Picard and first officer Malcom Reynolds have already thought of that.
@Mattophobia Elite is perfect in VR, but I can't play any game in VR for more than 20 mins.
@Mattophobia A lot of the game's staying power for me comes from setting my own goals - in particular tuning up my Asp for exploration.
@Mattophobia I totally understand that Elite can be hellishly grindy, and easy to fall into a dull gameplay loop, but I keep coming back.
@DavidPotter10 don't conflate per launch costs with development costs.
@bobby_1331 yes, and as we know the STS was the safest launch system ever.
@NASASpaceflight: Now we know what the NOTAM is about... Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel members sky diving into KSC to protest.  But s
So I'm hearing that NASA are being asked to investigate putting crew on first SLS launch. Instead of having an uncrewed test first.
@Mattophobia I mean I'd love it if they'd take the game engine and build a scripted campaign in the elite universe, separate from main game.
@Mattophobia you can say that for most games that hang a badly acted plot around the same game mechanics to extend it to 8 hours.
@Mattophobia beyond simple money making there's unlocking modules, ships, systems, factions, engineers and also a bunch of places to visit.
@Mattophobia There's tons to do, they just don't make it obvious and if you don't go looking you'll find yourself doing the same few things.
@Alejandro_DebH well @astVintageSpace knows all about the program, but who would you want in the pilots seat?
@Ryrytenten @DanNerdCubed @BlindGaming they all suck.
@zxczxczbfgman @WolfBaginski @KerbalSpaceP gas mask probably won't help against hydrofluoric acid.
@DanNerdCubed Well networks don't do anything useful for all but the top creators on their books anyway.
@ancient_culture no time to look at paper in detail but I face palmed at the idiots promoting 'Electric Sky' in the comments.
@KerbalSpaceP I'm pretty sure that with all that carbon and hydrogen it could work as a low ISP rocket fuel with the right oxidizer.
@ShamsJorjani @KasperVld @TheWesterFront I still think there's room for a great sci-fi space war game where light-speed limits comms.
@ShamsJorjani @KasperVld @TheWesterFront OK I admit it's not yet to CKII standards, but if it keeps getting developed it'll get there.
@ShamsJorjani @KasperVld @TheWesterFront But Stellaris is great!
@esa @AsteroidDay Preparing for 30th June right?
@TheAVClub Forest Gump. I hate that movie with a passion.
@eclipticflyer08 that's what we have... hence why we expected more effort to contact us.
@AustinOnSocial that's fake, you just screengabbed that from Minecraft.
@Mynxee @oaklandsanimals the manager told Amy 'the computers are off'....
@mattybfj @oaklandsanimals sure they have him, making him stay and extra night. Not a good thing for any animal.
Amy tried to get Lucky from @oaklandsanimals today, manager said no because it's a city holiday. Other person arrived and; got their dog back.
We still haven't got our dog back, East Bay SPCA never contacted us, passed him to Oakland Animal Services who weren't open today.
@ZachWeiner I've been using old iPhones/iPods and $20 lapel mics.
@manicvelocity I really want to come back.... and bring the kids.
@Chris84567 likely scenario is photographer has sec clearance, cleared photo ahead of time and had photos reviewed afterwards.
@Chris84567 photos like that are taken by presidential staff to document work. They're only released after review to make sure no leaks.

@JudsonCc bass was heavy, then tune went into a breakdown by the time I started accelerometer app.
@ThyCallHimBrian @YouTube It's well known that they had wine just after landing
@ZachWeiner and then have kids explain movies they haven't seen and only know from memes on the internet.

@Salvius23 @SwiftOnSecurity @johnpodesta I've literally used headphones as makeshift microphones at DJ gigs.
@neilhimself going to have to try replicating this space vehicle in a simulation @KerbalSpaceP
@ColinPearceUK Sure, but as long as you land it before the bingo call efficiency makes no difference, desc fuel isn't used after landing.

@Daniel37Parker Isn't that obvious? I mean the name says it all.
@webmonkees @SPACEdotcom yep, policy still exists even though current occupant of whitehouse purged document.
@SwiftOnSecurity more than one answer though, wealthy romans had higher exposures hence 'mad emperor syndrome'.
@hws5mp yeah, I mentioned this in my Vostok video.
@FellipeC @astVintageSpace i'm 100% going to recommend it, but maybe she wants to come to Oakland some time toshow it off.
I actually think that Randall Munroe's 'What If....' captures my thought processes. If asked those questions I would come to same answers.
Next month I'm giving another presentation, and the venue asked if I have books to sell because they have a budget for this. Suggestions?
@SystemCoruption @dfjsteve nah, they won't want boring jobs.
@dfjsteve truly smart robots will choose to fail tests for boring jobs.
@dfjsteve: A sufficiently advanced AI would chose to fail the Turing Test.

Tonight Skye is going to be performing some classic tunes as part of her school - looking forward to Bohemian Rhapsody
@fcain back then I did a homegrown 'PBM' version of 'galactic ruler'. Wrote GM code in GFA basic.
@SwiftOnSecurity I'm a computer person and a space person, brain parses based on context.
Viewer sent me a game based on a concept I'd tried to make as a teenager in the 80's. Great minds think alike and all that.
@syn3rax So, doesn't this mean every ship will have to have every possible player model baked into it?
@hws5mp very common around here, perfectly acceptable.
@TakeOnTheGame: Our Rovers are ready for the official #TakeOnMars roll-out later this week. Initiating countdown sequence: T minus 2 day
@fdGhtP54 @fivek good thing that millions are doing it for free.
@InannaAkbar they're protected by the rule of cool.
@Lee_Ars @dciskey Thanks for response, but I think I've figured it out. Nothing like asking for help to motivate understanding.
@SJ_Parkinson that's part of the question, not an answer.
@umangdighe No, more specific to mic placement and audio paths. Of course @TheRealBuzz would know, but I'm sure he's busy.
Started making video then realised I needed to know details of Apollo 11 comms that I can't find, anyone know an expert who'd answer Q's?
@killroy42 you guessed it, when the machines take over and accelerate climate change to purge the earth of life they'll need this to survive
@HiveTVDvl @YouTube yeah, that's the update I covered
@Rubbzy I'm not the person to talk to, I got seduced out of my astronomy research into a tech job.

@arstechnica @DrPizza Hopefully the 1080p30 mode looks a lot better than my existing Logitech - I really need a better webcam for my PC.
@RaineyMarkR no, rockets should follow trajectories which minimize deltaV as opposed to minimizing time.
@CraigyFerg It'll look a lot less Scotlandy when you drive by Vandenberg, I hear they're launching an ICBM test this week.
@rndsumgen yep, gonna miss having a president that can mic drop like a pro.
Managed to drop my lapel mic in my cup of tea and not notice for 5 minutes.... well that's a whole $25 wasted.

@HL10PM you're conflating waste from mining coal and burning coal.
@MrChuckD @iamclintmansell mechanical perfection is the root of musical mediocrity.
@WernerTwertzog @iamclintmansell don't worry, even if we move Humanity to other stars there's the heat death of the universe waiting for us.
@HL10PM you seem to be confused about this process, this is after mining.
@DanTwoHundred I know you're referencing Trek, but hope you know the origin of that phrase is Peter Pan.
@EveOnline And here's me sitting on a script I kept on meaning to record. Explaining how I made trillions....
@BrianFargo I just remember napalm bombing the crowds with fire horns. (which I duplicated using the read only disk bug).
@_MeBaran Besides they'd just invent another layer of conspiracy. Conspiracy theorists fit observations to their world view.
@_MeBaran I wouldn't want to reward such idiocy.
@WrongThinkBlog @steam_games rule on steam seems to be the more hours you put into games the more likely you are to write a bad review.

@FuturamaKing @smartereveryday There's a scene in that show thatshows her showing a bunch of clueless men how to fix an overheating car.
@smartereveryday And before she was Queen, she was, among other things, a car mechanic.

@hankgreen also, in 2nd Shuttle flight Joe Engle flew entire reentry and landing, only person to ever do this.
@hankgreen if you jumped out Shuttle at 30,000 ft you would fall slower than Shuttle, it would land before you hit the ground.
@felix_warren it has to break the plane of the goal line - just like in soccer.
@neiltyson: In North-South oriented stadiums, like NRG in Houston, Earth rotation deflects a 50-yd field goal to the right by 1/2 inch.
@montanakennedy @neiltyson I don't rap, I'm the DJ on the wheels of steel.
Will not be tweeting snarky comments about Super Bowl commercials because I have to take Orion to doctors.
@Alex_Parker @EliteDangerous It would be tidally locked if the coder hadn't missed a couple of decimal places in the orbital period.
@PrototypeCube @EliteDangerous I said 'fix it! So, not everyone. Thought it would be better as a mystery elsewhere.
@doug_ellison: This is probably peak BS from @MoonwatcherSat - first paragraph is BS. Scientific BS,then a 'watching it from the moon'..
@hankgreen re: 'from those countries' - it's possible to have citizenship of some of those countries without ever visiting, though birth.
@alikchialeika What people need to learn about CKII is that it's not winning that matters, failing at CKII is the best way to learn.
@TheRealPlato Yes - US docking adapters at front, Russian at the back.
Disappointed that the DJ tonight at the Trek event hasn't played any Beastie Boys or Public Enemy. Trek party needs classical music.
@huslage well I enjoyed I, but I live a mile away and have a membership. Great part of a longer day at Chabot.
@NASASpaceflight @YouTube I believe CAPCOM on that mission was Scott Altman - one of the pilots who flew F-14's for Top Gun.
@NASASpaceflight @YouTube This is one of the great launch loops, showing engineers doing what they're paid to do.

@SpeedyH30 @ProfBrianCox @BillNye there are many reasons, but it's a lot easier to convince these individuals face to face.
@hws5mp I like to point out that many flight sims let you design wing shapes, but KSP is the only one to model wing flexing.
@DJSnM @FosilLoki Also, SpaceX gets to scrutinize their rockets in detail after recovery - valuable data nobody else has.
@FosilLoki @verge I'm not sure it's such a big thing, given that there have been hundreds of engines flown with only one shutdown.
@arielwaldman don't worry, the most important KSP lesson is that failure is a valuable lesson.
@hankgreen @Medium Dammit, now I'm looking at my architects plans and trying to figure out where I'll shoot.
@arielwaldman you're still welcome to drop by my channel some day and crash rockets while talking about hacking space.
@arielwaldman @Patreon I gave you a shout out on my livestream, lots of people ask to donate to me and I don't need it, so I pass it on.
@MysteryGuitarM no, you'd watch Rogue One, IV, V, VI and then half way through when Ben tells look about Anakin, pause and show I, II, III

@Sceptical_Stan I'mwith you on the mess that religion and ideaologies make, people who reject observations that conflict with their ideas.
@TimoDenk I'm guessing 2 burns - one to launch and a second radial burn to make orbit? Also possible with single burn using WSB mechanics.
@sarahcruddas Space tourism is nice, but we won't truly have conquered orbit until we can bring our pets.
@S_W_Steiner There's plenty of honest people in government. Just make sure to pay attention to the ones trying to hide their dealings.

@iJoshing we can still talk and disagree on opinions, we just need to be comfortable accepting facts that disagree with our opinions.
@7brokenbricks here's a loaded question - how many times is 9/11 mentioned VS how many of 9/11 hijackers would be affected by directive.
@iJoshing should probably stop retweeting objective falsehoods from conservative review the. Else people might think you're a hypocrite.
@gamergody I'm in California, right now working with a kid protesting about homework.
@iJoshing context should be 'scott's a smart guy who knows stuff and recognizing lies and fake news isn't rocket science'.

@DJSnM @TransitionLucid in science you absolutely need to detach yourself from your opinions otherwise you'll end up wasting time.
@TransitionLucid It's ok to be skeptical of data, but not all data is created equal, and odds are data that fits your expectations is bad.
@TransitionLucid where does CO2 go then because biomass isn't capturing it fast enough.
@TransitionLucid it is accurate, that amount goes into atmosphere where it enters the carbon cycle. Do you happen to be an expert on this?
@TransitionLucid and the other 55% gets dissolved in water, leading to ocean acidification.
@7brokenbricks sorry for slow response, playing games with family.
@7brokenbricks so the order covers everyone, even residents who'd lived here decades having been vetted by DHS several times already.
@7brokenbricks can you find any language that applies to people who have already undergone extreme vetting to become permanent residents.
@7brokenbricks I mean are you suggesting POTUS didn't intend to block legal residents because he didn't know how USCIS works?
@7brokenbricks @elonmusk intended effect is what's in presidential Decree, but US law is limiting intent.
@7brokenbricks @elonmusk probably should have figured that out before turning back legal permanent residents who live here.

@yp3pa anyway, if everyone stops buying Mexico imports how does that pay the construction costs?
@yp3pa yep, more money in communities makes for more productive economy. Same reason why tax cuts are ineffective in local economy.
@yp3pa I can afford to buy local. But POTUS should probably stop saying Mexico will pay if plan is to make US Consumer pay.

@BadAstronomer @ZachWeiner @JamesSACorey funny thing is while I did a ton of research on science of Epstein drive, I completely missed this.
@HisRoyalCarlnes yeah I don't know, but I expect it'll be more noticeable if congress approves this.
@markleese1 @Independent It's not a fuel source, but it is pretty awesome.
@HenkelBen @nebulous_nl @ZekeJMiller @PressSec yes it would, or chinese or anything not mexican. But people would pay more.
@HisRoyalCarlnes I think the main things I see are farm produce and durable goods like cars and HVAC
@HenkelBen @ZekeJMiller @PressSec if the product that you're importing now costs 20% more, don't you have to raise prices to cover costs?
@HenkelBen @ZekeJMiller @PressSec like an import tax?
@HenkelBen @ZekeJMiller @PressSec How are they going to collect those taxes?
@GeminiJ13 this is a statement from executive branch. Congress has made it clear it doesn't like taxes and may have different ideas.
@GeminiJ13 Yep, and if the elsewhere at higher cost is less than 20% greater that's what would happen. Shipping is getting insanely cheap.
@GeminiJ13 it's the 'time' part - tariffs cause behaviour change which takes time, but market quickly adapts.
@lynagn @KevinAllred Avocado prices are rising because of the drought in California and a grower's strike in Mexico. Will recover next year.
@GeminiJ13 then that hurts US manufacturers and encourages opening factories in Mexico.
@evildrganymede Indeed - I am uncertain of the veracity of the statement of the import tax which would be passed on to consumers.
@crashfrog @rikkuness don't start me on that math - the effect is exaggerated ridiculously.
I did my @ExpanseSyfy science script in one take, then realized I wanted viewers to understand that I love the show, hence end plate.
@xRedster And that 16.9 million number comes from CNN, who reported 21million streams in 2009. But POTUS seems more concerned with crowds.
@xRedster That's the one that's coined the 'alt-facts' soundbite.n Nobody would care if it wasn't for POTUS *still* stating bad facts.
@xRedster of course he's allowed to make mistakes. But the evidence to the contrary was overwhelming prior to conference. Has he retracted?
@xRedster glad you like my work, you must appreciate science. But are you really saying you'd rather have propaganda rather than truth?
@PaulDalyROI I believe the study's abstract mentions Estonian.
@caranha Yeah, that's why I used the word 'suggests' rather than 'shows' or 'proves' - not much room in tweet for caveats.
@TransitionLucid basic chemistry : 1mol C = (12g) + 2mol Oxy (32g) =&gt; 1mol CO2 (44g) so mass increases &gt;3x from atmospheric oxygen.

@huslage Orion is 10, he got a bit bored during Arrival, but enjoyed this all the way through.
The way Euler's method is brought up makes total sense, they'd reached limits of more complex analysis and de ide to brute force math.
Euler's method is 'baby's first physics sim' people do it and the. Find out name later. Really requires computer to make it relevant.
I found a bit of the writing involving math to be... probably wrong. Like Euler's method, nobody has to look up a book if they know name.
Finally got to see Hidden Figures with whole family, everyone loved it. Even Orion, who said it's much better than Batman vs Superman.
@stfnebner it's '4/5' so harder than average. I'm probably making a complete mess.
@Kamik423 yeah they don't do a good job on S2 engines.
@doug_ellison one suggestion, is to fix interstates on immediately rather than waiting for glue to dry, they hold shape better.

@mich_linux_guy @akornblatt how about government stops spending billions subsidizing old fossil fuel industries that'll help with debt.
@mich_linux_guy @akornblatt you've given me fromarguing scientist are putting politics first (they're not) to arguing change is impossible.

I'm doing the math on the Epstein drives used in 'The Expanse' - if anyone tells you the show is realistic, the propulsion suggests not.
@Mattophobia because you read about the data collection that app was performing right? Or was there something else that's troubling you?
@DSLauretta tried playing Xtronaut with the family last night, problem is the kids want to spend ages trading, any rules to speed up game?
@AustinOnSocial life is a continual struggle against the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

@AustinOnSocial knowing thermodynamics and the inevitable heat death of the universe puts everything into scale.
@drolandcorp3230 macs released in 2009 got latest MacOS. Razer haven't released Win 10 drivers for gear from 2013 - planned obsolescence.

An Aircraft not @waywardboat - unless it's been taking flying lessons.
'MiffCo' is MFCO - Mission FLight Control Officer - the person in charge of public safety. Sounds like a range violation. Wayward Boat?
@CrazyOwlGhost Also important to note that modern software was able to adapt and save the mission, decades ago it would have failed.
@CrazyOwlGhost Centaur had 39m/s of delta V left after insertion, margin was tiny.
Propulsion is go for launch, hoping that they still have time.
Sound like they're pretty sure they've loaded enough fuel on there, so looking good.
@boomtnt46 It's hard to make a sensor that would work for a super bright rocket engine and something more mundane.
@jaredhead Right, final orbit is classified, but people usually find them pretty fast.
@boomtnt46 yes, you won't be able to launch your rockets in secret any more.
@jaredhead But that's actually an example of how to minimize perturbations, so forget that.
I don't have all the answers - remember I'm not a pro at this by any means.
So yeah I may have been wrong about the SBIRS orbit, 24 hour period but inclined to equator, which means launch window is important.
@MJLaukala hah yeah, I misunderstood, trying to find some actual data on target orbit.
@jaredhead I guess it depends on inclination relative to equator.
@LloydTWhite They have to arrange for everyone's schedules, and also close down areas for range safety, limited window for this.
Because this is a geosync satellite there's no real astronomical reason for a launch window, it's mostly organizing everyone and everything.
@weissbrot_LzZ the 30 minute hold allows them to work on problems without the countdown running. I'm not convinced, but everyone does it.
SBIRS is a geosync satellite which looks for infrared flares associated with missile launches.
I believe tonights launch is an Atlas V 401 which is the smallest version offered - 4m Faring, 0 SRBs, 1 RL-10 Engine on Centaur.
@alanburchill You know what my day job is right?
@MysteryGuitarM Last time they were asked they said no difference in the insurance.
@TheSaberLion But these days, it needs to work so I can get more relevant work done. Also - needs good build quality, and 1440p screen.
@TheSaberLion 20 years ago I embraced the fun of getting linux running on whatever I could find, even writing my own drivers.
@TheSaberLion Right that's the thing for me cost is barely a factor, 100% perfect hardware support is more important.
Rewatching Skratchcon 2000, I remember watching this and wanting to learn to do it, 17 years later I've decided to leave it to the pros.
@TheSaberLion But neither of those are officially Unix, they may comply with UNIX'03 but not registered. MacOS is officially a UNIX '03 OS.
@TheSaberLion Unix is the top reason why I use an Apple laptop.
@Lambert2191 It has 4 USB ports. Besides statements like that remind me of people complaining about computers without floppy disks.

@DJSnM the Percy Sledge original is so perfect any cover version is musically irrelevant, nobody should ever cover that tune.
@DJSnM there are worse tunes for sure like Michael Bolton's cover of 'When a Man Lives A Woman'.
To be fair the Gary Jules cover version is a competent piece of music, it's also hideously mediocre and nondescript.
Skye is playing 'Mad World' in violin, she's never tried before, but it's already superior to the Gary Jules version.
@imago_loop I heard that Ceos/Sothis is alive again, but not as lucrative.

@TwinStickGames @JigenD @howieeday yeah it's not built into a lot of licensing. Rebel Galaxy was great but I couldn't cover it much.
@pjf there have been way too many social hurdles. A small subset of modders causing a lot of drama
@TwinStickGames @JigenD @howieeday looking forward regardless. Sort the music licensing ahead of time though.
Updates to KSP add much needed core features but break many more mods, and many mod devs are done with maintaining their work.
@Wizarth @pjf I personally think that@KerbalSpaceP has reached a critical point where new versions are breaking too many mods.
@pjf @Wizarth CKAN should go to the next level and start archiving the KSP versions from steam automatically.
@pjf the book even taught me a few things about KSP (never built a model before).

@Stewy13 I'm quite happy that my new MBP will support 4x4K monitors.
@Stewy13 regardless, the real deal breaker on the surface is the non unix OS which makes it useless to me for serious devs work.
@Stewy13 I've heard that 2x4k at 30Hz is possible, but buggy.
@Stewy13 pfft... these have the ability to run more screens at higher resolutions than some grown up tablet.
10/10 deployments confirmed. Mission successful.
So let's hope it's just a telemetry issue that's keeping everyone in suspense.
@DJSnM some will burn to accelerate forwards relative to the others, and because of orbital mechanics will ultimately orbit slower.
To spread out along orbit, the satellites will make tiny burns with their station keeping engines to slow down or speed up.
So now they'll deploy 10 iridium satellites into this orbit. Over time they will spread throughout the orbit by small adjustments to period.
This burn is only 4 seconds, raising Apogee to the correct altitude.
Looks like SpaceX have telemetry back for the 2nd stage. Getting ready for final short burn to tune the orbit.
After thes Sats get into their Orbit SpaceX has big plans for the coming year - Falcon Heavy, Booster Reuse and; Crew Dragon Test.
Congratulations to the SpaceX video comms people who managed to keep a live feed going through that epic achievement.
Now it'll be a 40min while they coast before boosting into correct orbit for Iridium.
Right in the middle of the inner circle.Meanwhile the 2nd stage engine has cut off and is in low orbit.
Remember the last time they tried a landing from a VAFB launch the rocket fell over.
MECO and stage successful. Both vehicles now have different missions.
Even after reload and refresh the technical stream is 8 seconds ahead.
Oh yeah it's Test Shot Starfish - a reference to the Starfish Prime that detonated nuclear weapons in space.
@dmiller742 A betting man should know how to read the odds.
@derickr That's a good question, I wonder if @IridiumBoss can answer this question - will we need new Iridium flash models?
@LloydTWhite Ever heard of a satellite phone? That's what Iridium does. Providing global communication.
@katrobison @SpaceX If you enjoy numbers going down there's lots of games where the excitement is numbers going up!
It's been 15 years since replacement satellites were launched, so this is a big step forward. 15 years ago Iridium was considered a failure.
Iridium satellites are in 6 planes of high (86) inclination orbits, 11 operational in each plane with spares ready to take up slack.
@benthewolf Insert my usual dreams about building a musical soundtrack to a countdown and launch
This launch is from Vandenberg so if you're in SoCal you might get a chance to see it as it heads south. Only 3rd SpaceX launch from VAFB
Todays launch has an instantaneous window, they need to hit the right orbital plane to replace aging/failing Iridium satellites.
Less than 1 hour to SpaceX launch - fueling will be well underway by now.
@cstross I remember the hardware, and how unreliable it was, I stayed away from smartphones for a long time after that first experience.
Wrote up a bunch of stuff for 'KSP Doesn't Teach Ion Thrusters' only to realise it would be an hour long.....
@HighContrast I am skeptical about many thing related to the TS Sequel, but I know the soundtrack will be great.
@TheYunners Yeah I saw this a couple of years ago.
@DJSnM I should point out that a Martian year is 687 Earth days, so that goal makes more sense in mars time.

@ZenoRogue @g4vr0che you're right, so, how do you describe the wrap around metric used for old single screen games?
@ZenoRogue @g4vr0che You measure curvature by drawing shapes on the surface - e.g. triangles or circles.
@BadAstronomer It was the first Star Wars movie where I saw imperial troopers armour actually stopping shots.
I honestly wonder how often Nigel Tufnel's 'None More Black' quote is used in stories about Vantablack and other @SurreyNanoSys technology.
I used to be able to pick up the game audio of Dungeon Master from my Atari ST with a radio, was too young to understand why at the time.
@mbanzi @pakman shame it won't simulate the RF interference which was how you got music out the original.
@TimOfLegend Shame there's no 'youth program' for teenagers interested in the industry.
@ZenoRogue @g4vr0che curvature is not zero, consider what happens when the radius of the test geometry gets larger than the screen.
@ObsidianDev @NASA impractical for sure, depends how much curvature you want to accept.
@dciskey My building has an Anish Kapoor sculpture in the lobby.
@kammadeva it's patented. Also, only applies to art, I know optic manufacturers have a real need for the tech.
Vantablack is a partial acronym, standing for 'Verticall Aligned Nano-Tube Array' - it uses arrays of nanotubes to absorb almost all light.
@ObsidianDev @NASA the slower you go, the more gravity curves trajectory, accelerate at 1g for hours and curve less.

@luke_j_obrien @nyrath @JamesDrewNews @AviationWeek 13 inches in diameter, 12 feet long, variable yield up to 300kt.
@compoundchem Need to do it again in even slower motion.
@angbor3D Yeah, also I just noticed a firmware upgrade to Theta S added 1080p/30fps streaming over USB in November.
@fifthgearonline @smartereveryday I had this experience with national newspapers and TV channels.
@smartereveryday also I can't help but notice the ad server think you really want to get a Skid Steer.
@hablmet but you can't do seamless 360 with a single GoPro.
@angbor3D I can totally understand why the livestream is only 2K. Hope they're just keeping 4K recording support secret.
@smartereveryday @Wimpcom this is sadly normal practice for many news sites.
@smartereveryday: Very Sneaky! When I invoiced @Wimpcom for stealing and uploading the latest video, they quietly changed the site to th
@angbor3D right, I just need to record 4K video, live streaming is not a feature I'm after.
@Ruairi_Iliffe Make a space sim where you use hand controllers to grab the walls to move. 'Freefall messes with your motion perception'
@Ruairi_Iliffe the most immersive VR experience ever.
GameDevs: instead of trying to fix Motion Sickness in VR you should just be writing plots where the character suffers from motion sickness.
@xZise That's a good plan, kOS has a lot of features and I'm only vaguely familiar with it.
@Soon0153 @KerbalSpaceP peripherals? I've barely used a joystick with it.
@ThatDearGuy nah I'd been looking at it since before Christmas, figured it was better to cover in livestream.
@boxmaker709 @KerbalSpaceP You missed your launch window and needed to expend more resources to catch up.
@Dayna_Latham Worth noting that they all use Pratt and; Whitney engines.
#TheBestMoneyIHaveEverSpent was when I spent $7 to buy Kerbal Space Program in early access.Thanks @KerbalSpaceP
@SwiftOnSecurity: Just want to emphasize, all the computer security experts I've seen are 100% okay with nukes staying controlled by flo
@nf6x @nyrath I saw these things but was too poor to afford one. Had to swap cables every time
@NikonUSA I had so many things I wanted to use it on, but the awful iOS support and bad stitch lines made it unusable at launch.
@JDeedubzeW @humble Played enough, Black Flag is hella fun.
@The_Tiptonian Ahh, well I did resort to savefile editing to kick things off.
@SimoRoth does it include the infamous Numerical Recipies headers which includes macros to make C arrays start at 1 instead of 0?
@McMurchie The race presented doesn't appear to be aquatic since they clearly move around in air.
Finally got to see 'The Arrival', loved it and glad to see it's still selling out 4 shows a day at my local cinema.
@sh0v0r Still saying we need a VR wingsuit sim where hand position controls aerodynamics.
Ok SpaceX anomaly video voice recorded, now for the art.....
@zzzap78 @WillMcPhail @NewYorker more like 'look at how well I drive a bus, a plane is like a bus with wings'.
@RickdeJong1997 @SpaceX yes, unfortunately no video from anomaly for ContentID reasons, so more MS paint.
I've been trying to tune a reactionless drive system in KSP, and pushing the limits of kOS in doing so. Video soon.
@HomuckTristan the error tells you all you need to know move the contents of OPT up one level into GameData
@Casillic @nyrath I remember discussing these in the context of how far a warhead would travel while exploding at high encounter speeds.
@chrisremo: Playing Glittermitten Grove to unlock Frog Fractions 2 has revealed that I really like Glittermitten Grove.
@DJSnM I just find it heartwarming that kids can be immersed in DnB from an early age.
Given the time delay I'm curious what people base their NYE countdown on
And so, finally, a happy new year from Oakland, California. May 2017 bring great things to you.
The KRON4 tv coverage is 10 seconds behind reality, don't rely on it.
Almost there, we're laid back on the west coast.
@th1rt3en_TM @BadAstronomer also beware some PAL transfers took 24fps and cranked it at 25fps to display nicely on 50 Hz displays.
Unfortunately our NYE party invites all fell through so it's a family NYE

@hankgreen would have a twitter handle of @tweetyourshelf
@Anpanator I worked there for a summer job 25 years ago, I tested these while they were perfecting the design.
@ACSReactions #1 rule for me was always 'Don't go to sleep drunk' - stay awake, have a cup of tea, play some games, create something.
@Cmdr_Hadfield That was awesome, but the first one happened in 2015. What was a first was the barge landing.
@DThyholdt @0nyiax it's about the ratio of arm lengths.
@Mattophobia ditto, I tried to pay Skye to make mine for a while. Sometimes the thumbnail makes or breaks the click through rate.
@hankgreen let's be clear, when it comes to your kid's abilities you're going to be biased. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong.
@BadHorse not KSP related, someone more qualified to write books beat me to that.
@fdGhtP54 that's a secret. But some of the chapters would cover videos I've already made.
Actually the big problem is that in the last year I started writing 2 different books and I need to focus on one.
Under pressure to come up with new year resolutions (at a Hannuka celebration) I decided I'd actually finish my book in 2017.
@GeminiJ13 @PeterGleick yep, although it's one of those fields where the good science covers multiple disciplines. E.g. Dendrochronology
@GeminiJ13 @PeterGleick true, perhaps acknowledge is not a forceful enough term for many of those statements.
@hankgreen distinct from 'doorable' - an adjective describing surfaces coated with Aperture Science's special moon dust paint.
@PeterGleick: Every major scientific/geophysical society and; national academy on earth acknowledges that humans are causing #climate chang
@JibberMac There are many good reasons to explain it, the real question is which one - what's yours?
@wpattison Unfortunately the 'free market' doesn't work well with last mile utilities. No other viable options in my location.
My 'smart' TV got confused and was showing a non-prime version of The Expanse had to add it back to my watchlist using website. Very odd.
@HighContrast Of course, it does beg the question of what tune you'd drop just before it.. well dropped.
@HighContrast don't worry, I know a few things about cosmic armageddon, and this isn't going to do anything this time around.
@Thom_astro: Space hamburger: tortilla, rehydrated beef, fresh onion from #HTV6, @ISS_Research lettuce and; sauce. Tasted like heaven, flew
@KerbalSpaceP: #KSP was nominated for the #SteamAwards in the #BoomBoomAward category @steam_games and NOW is the time to cast your vote
@bhgross144 @neilhimself @atlasobscura @lenadunham @mary_roach @RealGDT @PetitWTC @jonronson I gave this to my wife and she loves it.
@SandiGardiner I will be happy when these get added to the game so I canhighlight the increased character diversity.
@giuseppebernal the only other thing I'd recommend is X3 - Terran Conflict/Albion Prelude. Less realistic, but more toys in sandbox.
@giuseppebernal Oh yeah this won't have running around any time soon (future DLC) but it'll give you plenty to do. Get Commander Edition.
@DanNerdCubed 'incesty' - you should see some of the deleted comments from todays video where my kids restrain me with duct take.
@giuseppebernal It's by far the best space sim available, but it's also a game where you're just another pilot rather than a hero.
@Lobomeister See also rich politicians passing laws to help them stay rich.
@Lobomeister look it up, it's when a group that has previously exploited a system for gain 'levels the playing field' to stop others.
@MonkehDave Yes, I made a video about tape physics. Did you know tape was used to isolate the first samples of graphene?
I posted a video of me trying to fly a plane after being bound with duct tape, and the top comment is a discussion of tape terminology.
Apparently 17 Draconis is getting UA bombed in #elitedangerous generally by older players experiencing cases of FYGM.
@SeanDysinger Yep, need to do some more with the RC1 update.
@KariByron @ThatJBrown @TheCrucible Skye just turned 12 - old enough to do the youth Welding, glass blowing or Blacksmithing classes.
@avarisclari @OverworldTheme I kinda upload a lot of video to the internet...
@ThatJBrown @KariByron I wonder if there's anywhere in the bay area that does father/daughter welding classes.
@TheStevenB Nah the numbers are legit. PS4 HDD upgrade + Star Citizen downloads really boosted my usage this month.
@hankgreen it was settable in options in the Adsense linked to the account. Entirely possible this has changed in last few years.
@hankgreen also, when ad inventory is low YouTube has been known to serve channel trailers as pre-rolls. We don't pay YouTube for this.
@hankgreen should also point out we have the option to enable/disable certain classes of ads like Alcohol and; Gambling.
@djwaves79 for 'reasons' it never got released outside of North America. That should be fixed in 2017 along with a big update.
@SimoRoth @ThatEricAlper I remember the turbo button, and I did understand it! I knew enough to do weird stuff with ModeX. Turbo was easy.
@DirtyCodeMonkey which is exactly what I was trying to clarify after my previous discussion of 64 bit positioning.
@BadAstronomer there are some great apps which stack multiple exposures to get good sky shots from such a tiny aperture.
@QuantumRand yeah, not streaming because the blood is too distracting
@ShujinTribble I have everything XCOM, even the FPS
Also, seriously considering buying Resident Evil 4 for the 4th time because it's half price in PSN
Hit my head on a cupboard door and it just won't stop bleeding.... this is normal.
@Kamik423 @ZantiMisft that's at odds with the 'rebel' theme.
@DJSnM should probably mention this is Talisman from @FFGames
@DirtyCodeMonkey I was told the rendering pipeline so. The GPU were translated to 32bit because most GPU's have terrible DP performance.
@DJQbert Stull happens, but with experience your ability to recognize, rationalize and rise above internal negativity improves.
@PIneptos like the 'inevitable consequences of piracy'?
@PIneptos apparently they're offended by the word 'diversity' and I should have used the word 'realism' instead.
@MaxSingularity Did you know that only one spaceship with a princess on board escapes with the plans to the Death Star?
@MysteryGuitarM I confess I look at BSOD's to see if there's a hint of a potential exploit.
Skye is complaining about people spoiling Dr Who."If you can't take the spoilers then stay out of the internet."
@joespeed52 has a lot of heavy electronics, microphone and speaker (not to mention lights). it's not the cheap plastic mask you describe.
@LongHairNasaGuy @camerinhahn This is the project I'm looking for.
@katrobison @FiveThirtyEight @mars_stu I started trying to come up with a celebrity influence metric using Wikipedia to answer this.
@MobiusArchives do you think a plastic mask would have any effect on my voice?
@DJThomasGRN @Bethpresswood many of the core Christmas traditions are rooted in pagan ritual and we're co-opted by Christianity. Win/Win TBH
@Bethpresswood: Asking why atheists celebrate Christmas is like asking why people who don't want kids have sex
@LizzyTheSiren no, pigs in blankets is when it's a sausage in the middle
@PerpetualCoding it was a 520 STFM with single sided floppy and 512MB of ram. I later upgraded to double sided disk.
@KriLL3 @YouTube those people apparently thought that the addition of a non white character also implied purging of all existing models.
Disappointed that the blatantly racist knee jerk comments weren't filtered, while considered responses were spam filtered by @youtube.
@Mattophobia @_V_V_V___V_V_V_ don't forget House of the Dying Sun
@whitequark @eddyb_r @FrozenFire your laptop is probably vastly more powerful than the computer idea I used to model orbits 2 decades ago.
@clayonium pretty sure it's a reference to our local baseball team
@Alexthebassist2 that doesn't fix the fundamental deficiencies in an engine not designed for more than a few dozen players.
@llamasoft_ox I'm so glad that the game is perfect for some people.
@llamasoft_ox: The exception to that being NMS of course, scarcely a day gone by without my hour of chill on there.nnGOTY for me :)
@skyroguegame: Sky Rogue is 30% off! Annihilate your foes with the spirit of Christmas!n#indiedev #gamedev #lowpoly #screenshotsaturday
@Alexthebassist2 except that Lumberyard doesn't handle huge numbers of simultaneous players in an instance any more than stock cryengine.
Looks like the download page for the Star Citizen installer isn't actually working, needed to go from DL Page -&gt; Launcher FAQ -&gt; Direct link
@Mattophobia Amazon Prime in the US has them all for free right now, but having a hard time getting kids to watch.
@Mattophobia You mean the 6 Non-Disney Star Wars movies
@Mattophobia I bought my android tablet to play games I'd acquired through Humbe Bundle, back when I played things for fun :)
@DKerman_KSA there's some correlation between number of characters with facial hair on a poster and the number who die.
Having watched Rogue One a second time I noticed that this Star Wars movie has more major characters with facial hair than any other.

@DJSnM wondering what their reaction to Rogue One having 'Blakes 7' level of protagonist attrition.
@GrahamKHarper it's a better game that it was when launched, but X3 Terran Conflict/Albion Prelude is the place to be for all the mods.
@dom_s24 Yep, bu the discount on those isn't nearly as big.
@Mattophobia By american you mean United States of America right?
So, steam sale stuff KSP, X-Superbox, Alien Isolation, Starpoint Gemini 2, Space Engineers, Crusader Kings 2 Collection
Sure there's new ships and FPS in Star Citizen Alpha 2.6, but I'm most glad for the window finally being draggable.
@TheBibliofilus PlayStation 4 don't care 'bout steam
Finally got Orion excited about Rocksmith 2014 (still not wearing a shirt while playing) can't get all my old DLC to work though.
@antarctickitten @AleIndustries I've done that more than once, I've landed Apollo 11 after a 6 pack.
@hankgreen that's a pretty low bar to be honest.....
@AleIndustries yes, keeping a watchful eye over things.
@SparkVizla don't be afraid to reach out in the new year.

@Louis_bond It's not even deleted scenes, many of the shots in trailers represent a completely different continuity.

@Mattophobia The Beatles Yellow Submarine Lego set makes me double sad there will never be an export option.
I don't wishlist video games any more since it's a business. The gaming Christmas wishes I have is for Beatles and; Lego Rock Band on PS4
Can't say which set because it's a secret I don't want to share with family.
Got the last set in stock! Good thing I didn't wait til lunch time.
Starting the day with a quick visit to the Lego store.
@JackKowalsky err yes, that's more correct. Point is these models are great. Plenty of non space papercraft too
If you're struggling to find last minute presents for a crafty person who likes space there are tons of papercraft rockets. DL, print, build
@ulalaunch if you're on a budget, and waited to the last minute I recommend papercraft rockets like those designed by @axm61

@Barantor I do recommend getting the real-tone cable and an electric guitar at some point.
@Barantor There's also the non scoring 'play along' mode where it just displays the music and doesn't rate your playing.
@Barantor I learned most of my guitar skills from this 'game' (not really a game, it's the best guitar teaching tool there is).

@dramthethief Near misses can have terrible consequences when you're given ngodlike powers.
Beware though @AsmodeeDigital still haven't fixed Pandemic on my iPhone. Some bug is causing it to suck power atridiculous rates.
If you're interested in buying physical version the digital versions can tell you a lot about the game.

@ThatDearGuy you can't target parachutes with the precision they need.
@ZachWeiner I always recommend 'The Adventures Of Luther Arkwright' as probably the most criminally ignored when to if graphic fiction.
@HisRoyalCarlnes that was where the AV company is based. And majority of cheap android devices are made in China.
Makes me think of the Atari Jaguar, after production stopped the molds for the case were acquired by a medical equipment manufacturer.
@dduane @Alex_Parker @scalzi Also need a version for gamers I think @AdamSessler would like these.
@realAlexHuszar These are for my kids, so not spending tons of money since they'll probably break them.

@ClpsdWavFnctn I don't use earbuds of any sort, I prefer headphones.
@doug_ellison FAA should get on his case and get to educating the public then.
@doug_ellison what about Jessie - the dude who's with him. Wouldn't he be the guyflying the drone since Casey's doing the kitesurfing?
@doug_ellison With his high profile the amount of money he's making @CaseyNeistat would be dumb not to follow FAA rules at this point.

@Boogie2988 I find it amusing when commenters suggest I get a real job, even more so when I see them posting from iOS.

@JCHovis yeah I understand in the US I'm supposed to check with ATC if flying within 5miles of airport, which covers most of Oakland....
@LonelyProbe @SarcasticV2 @neiltyson Why not just fall back to the usual space probe glitch excuses -'Cosmic rays' or 'Solar Flares'
@AlexTheViolinst nah, Orion's drone doesn't do realtime FPV, and I'm guessing the Mavic is more about video.
@neiltysonalso, don't waste money subsidizing irrelevant industries, clinging to 50's tech, doesn't restore 50's economic prosperity.
@salamanderrake @imgur not strictly true, but people keep telling this story because it's funny.
@sebseb7 @Vimeo I'd love to have the spare time, that's the bottleneck, not money.

@Mattophobia technically, it's a business expense.
Finally took the plunge on a decent quality drone, got a deal on a DJI Mavic, but it won't arrive until February.
@SimoRoth sounds a little like a concept I had but the fluid was 'aether' and it was spacecraft being designed.
@Alex_Parker: Humans have used hydraulics for thousands of years, so naturally that's the system that acts up on the space-robot carryin
@FuelRats @CMDR_RayMobula @Rick3221 I literally spent a couple of hours today doing the math for docking using sextants and slide rules.
@CMDR_RayMobula @Rick3221 @EliteDangerous @FuelRats @DavidBraben I was just lucky, always zeroing throttle in witch space.
@CMDR_RayMobula @Rick3221 @EliteDangerous @FuelRats @DavidBraben I have to say I never brought an AFMU on my voyage to core and; back.
Now they're playing a Mexican version of Auld Lang Syne on brass and; accordions. Love it.
@Kerrrash nope, got family stuff going on, willing to give everyone else a chance for now.
I fully expect someone in the Elite Beta with more patience to go in and make something faster still. I had room for improvement.
@AthanSpod 'those who forget history are condemned to be mocked by those who know the Powerdrome did spaceship racing in the 80s'
@oskarelmgren Not if it means stripping weapons and shields off your ship.
@elanstreaming I am familiar with @EliteRacers but I'm all for making it an easily accessed core feature. With improved mechanics.
@Maeyae42 yeah, in the beta it's easier, but I still had to dump hundreds of tons of fish on Marco Qwent for this.
I really think that Frontier should consider racing as a season 3 feature for Elite.
@dave_korb @SpaceflightNow @OrbitalATK I did a Pegasus style launch in @KerbalSpaceP a long time ago.
@renee_lung @gudenauPub @ThePracticalDev It's just computer printouts of the code, not punchcards. Not machine readable.
@Drunken_Jedi @valross2 It's not that the Macs got more expensive, its that some idiots caused a political crisis which devalued the pound.
Orion likes to take his shirt off when playing @RockBand is this a common thing?
@JoshuaBaer @RichardGarriott @SamsungMobile @WaltDisneyWorld just wait until I show you my 360 videos of slingshots around a black hole.
@dweekly electrons are more expensive than cellulose.
@Th3angryman I own both starter sets and 2 expansion units.
@AtudayNaque in this case, Luke, he'd have been out if it wasn't for R2D2 fixing shields.
@CCP_Paradox CCP should look into doing an Eve Universe version of Armada.
@DJSnM if you know the game then the fact the Biggs hasn't been hit is strange because his special ability is to draw fire from others.
@orbitalpodcast @smartereveryday Nah just some very singed fingers.
@smartereveryday Hope your experience with glass blowing involved less burns than I sustained.
@Rainmaker1973 @nyrath Of course you need to appreciate that the space shuttle taking this picture is also falling towards the earth.
@SeohnAranys Yep, I saw that episode when it aired (wait, can you really air an episode when it's doing stuff in a vacuum?)

@hankgreen I've landed a lot of simulated spacecraft on planets, maybe time to try landing a Death Star.
Apparently Super Mario Run is online only, so no way for me to play on commute. No point in buying it then.
So the AGU Meeting is next week, and while I'm not attending I do work next door. Anyone want to meet for lunch? #AGU16
@gudenauPub @htcvive @KerbalSpaceP I've heard about mods but I'm afraid to try bad VR because it's just not fun.
@grantimahara @KariByron @netflixNASA build a simulator for this kind of vehicle in 1970s, same project invented the Balance Board.
@RyanRRuhl @KerbalSpaceP @MichiganAero @A2Steam I've always wanted to make an app which can construct a rocket from images on cards.
@DChristensen026 @AnoushehAnsari @Flipboard The evidence is more that they've been unable to rule it out.
@DanNerdCubed Wait, I'm suddenly confused, why does 221B Baker St look like it's flooded? It's upstairs.

@DanNerdCubed I've demonstrated my ability to fly rockets with my feet, and with my nose. so I'll be fine.
@fearonm honestly, this is the first I've heard about it and; upon looking at the page my first reaction is 'Oh hell yes'. Thanks @SilverLemur
@DoubleFine @boneloaf my kids will be so excited, been waiting for this forever.
People really want the follow up video on spinning black holes. The math is so much harder. OTOH less likely to mispronounce Kerr metric.
@sarahcruddas I'm still dreaming, and more importantly doing my best to make those dreams a reality for future generations.
Dammit, what terrible timing for Netflix to drop 'The RIght Stuff' from streaming in the US.
@SpliterCBb @NASA at least @TheRealBuzz saw 2016 coming and punched it like it was a conspiracy theorist.
The Wisdom of John Glenn:n"To sit back and let fate play its hand out and never influence it is not the way man was meant to operate"

@blob in reality there'd always be residual rotation.
@d3rrial The realization that the Schwarschild metric described a black hole didn't come until 4 decades after he died.
And stable circular orbits end at 3xRS which is therefore the inner edge of any accretion disc.
If you want to swing by a black hole any closer than 2xRS you need more and more excess hyperbolic velocity.
Funny thing about black hole is a parabolic orbit can fall into an unstable circular orbit at 2xSchwarzchild radius.
People think the closest you can get to a black hole and return is event horizon, when realistically it's twice that. (Unless rotating BH)
@d3rrial if only Karl hadn't died a year later he might have spent the rest of his academic career correcting pronunciation.
@turkuderringer it'll alway be called MSPaint, otherwise nobody would know what I was talking about.
Having doubts about whether to post my new science video since it's mainly using MSPaint art. Might write some code to make animations.
@Resender2be @BBCBreaking I remember this a couple of years ago. "OMG Old rock star is trending, he must have died. No he's a new father"
@EliteDangerous @YouTube is the surprise the sequence where we see non-FSD equipped fighters jumping into hyperspace. 
@Rick3221 @EliteDangerous I'd rather fly this route in space Engine :)
@empty1388 don't confuse opinions and facts, we're all entitled to our own opinion, but you can't have your own facts.
Is there a modern version of the 2 guards, 2 doors logic problem with fake news sites instead?
Logic implies that if a Fake news org is run a story that climate change is fake then that shows that climate change is real.
@MysteryGuitarM Unless you have bits of raw meat stuck between your teeth.
@SANEAlex_ @AsteroidDay I didn't notice, but I thought I was sharing the Siberia video....
Hard to put into words the disappointment felt when looking for favorite tunes for @RockBand and finding they're only available on SingStar.
@MinYatur_OW didn't know there was any flying till now, maybe I'll take a look. Still want a VR wingsuit sim with hand and; feet tracking.
@pocketmoon I'm sticking with TrackIR because of the more natural panel behaviour.

@AnoushehAnsari @Flipboard not many scientists think this, plenty of evidence that fundamental constants haven't changed.
@joaoeb @PedroLobo76 Even my kerbal videos have fewer viewers on average than my science content.
@PedroLobo76 But the majority of my traffic in the last month has been on science videos.
@pvt_anima OTOH science content makes gamers unsub, and game content makes science fans unsub.
@8bitadc The new channel will start out with zero subscribers.
@snizlefoot @emmablackery I thought I did, got myself a gift credit at Band;H and a camera bag.
OK asking for feedback from subscribers on what I should do regarding channel splitting.
@johnmknight Real or fictional? ISS is the best real spacecraft. Fictional, Alexey Leonov (2010), or Agamemnon (B5). ( spinning bits)
@The_Wyldcard Sometimes you have to take a stand against malicious actors misrepresenting you for political gain.
@emmablackery I hadn't thought about that. I've been on the fence about creating a new channel until now. Never got my silver play button.
@fohx @SimoRoth Getting a green screen is never expensive, lighting a green screen correctly will consume hours of your life.
@humesdog Yep I fumbled the block button and retweeted instead.
OK... I think I've scienced enough to have a clue about how I'm going to finish myvideo. My general relativity is a bit rusty.
@to_the_breach computing geodesics in a Schwarzchild metric.
Ahh crap, made a cool little science video and as I clicked upload I treatises it was missing a really important thing....

@beechnutkjr @KerbalSpaceP @xkcdComic I don't have the job at NASA part. But people who've had jobs at NASA tell me it's true.
@astVintageSpace I'm glad you still spell cheque correctly :)
@Lachee_ fire at a warehouse party, death toll is 36 so far.
@planetlabs @theAGU was thinking of going for fun, then I realized it clashed with Skye's birthday.
@DavidBrin This explains why my live kerbal streams involve such crazy ideas.
@TheYunners Honestly didn't think it was a big thing, it's merely approving names that already existed, standardizing the spelling.
@TheYunners Nah it's just that many stars have multiple names. I find Elite's naming interesting because they pick one possible name.
@TheYunners recently? It's had the name for centuries it means 'Foot of the Centaur', comes from the arabic naming.
@Champion_Songi one of the dead was a teacher at an elementary school in my neighborhood. Goes beyond families.
@roach great, now if only they'd bring back signs telling people to take their backpacks off on crowded trains.
@TheCavac how does that compare in terms of Cost/Power/LOC?
@MJtheProphet @BadAstronomer @ZachWeiner Not going to lie, I'd love tohang out with these guys and record the experience.
@DanNerdCubed But it was originally supposed to be on the PS3, so they missed their original target by 1 and; 1/2 console generations.
@Techn0gen @RichardFPenn @BadAstronomer @ZachWeiner I think we'd need to ask @TheRealBuzz for his opinion, he's the pro.
@RichardFPenn @BadAstronomer @ZachWeiner Tiny amounts if setup correctlly, most of the impulse comes from the gravity assists.
@hhas01 @rygorous @cstross reminds me of the old Windows global timer bug. Oh god, I hope they're not running this on Windows 95
@BadAstronomer @ZachWeiner this is actually a cycler. Uses a gravity assist to adjust longitude of perihelion by 0.041 each year.
@DanNerdCubed The question is how it ranks against SOTC and; Ico
@YTCreators Looks like lots of orbeez. I wonder how many orbeez video makers know that the same stuff is used in diapers.
@Xocliw @SpaceEngineersG welders would prefer to avoid working with materials that have toxic heavy metals......
@CCP_Falcon Looking at the screenshots and I see that Nightmare fleets are apparently a thing....
@turkuderringer yep, many of those places were in SOMA and got turned into office space. Residents moved to Oakland where it was cheaper.
@hankgreen on YouTube, subscribers is not the same thing as audience. My subs have never stopped growing, my audience is shrinking.
@tjtheawesomet Sure, let me do a rough tutorial right now.
@DanNerdCubed don't forget the inevitable arguments.
@iamclintmansell @snopes @Grategatsby @occultauralist @TerrySerio I bought into it in part because there's regional variations in UK papers.
@AndrewNCassidy @TerrySerio possibly, truthfully Murdoch is a business man and his media outlets focus on profit, which depends on audience.
@cstross it'll be the opposite, hundreds of zombie patents that'll serve as roadblocks to progress and; profitabilityfor decades to come.
@ThomasVanCott and I'll bet you've missed a ton of both.
@Alex_Parker: Enceladus entered the @NASAKeplerfield of view today, so I made enchiladas for dinner.
@SNAP_KICK @smartereveryday retry the experiment with different light positioning.
@SNAP_KICK @smartereveryday the light is coming from above right? So if it leans slightly whichever side is more 'up' is more illuminated.
@timoreilly @mental_floss when I was working on sentiment analysis we had special treatment for 'shit' vs 'the shit'.
@smartereveryday @SNAP_KICK the effect is determined by which color faces your when you start. Use an iPhone + 240FPS slow mo.
@riney years of playing first person shooters has made me mentally check every sniper vantage point as I walk down the street.
@riney yeah, there's a lot of space like that around here. Lots of great people, not all other them thinking about worst case scenarios.
@Kingofthebrit that's not a star, that's the planet Venus :)
Tonight Skye will be singing at Oakland Zoo as@part of ZooLights
@MarvelUK: Just revealed by @JamesGunn at Brazil Comic-Con - watch the official teaser trailer for Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.
The cocktail mixer problem was another 10 minute version, but I'd thought my way through the data before starting.
Ok the colour coordinating shoes Puzzle in Shenzhen I/O kicked my arse, took me almost an hour. Kept having wiring problems.
@enyapleinad @Rocksmithgame already tried when he was younger, perhaps time to try again.
@HolgerRiegel Was that in any of the previous RB releases?
I love that Orion has got addicted to Rock Band 4 and is alternating between trying to perfect AC/DC, Queen, Beastie Boys and Bon Jovi
@GeminiJ13 I think it was just a fire that caught very quickly, in an old building with no sprinkler system.
@arstechnica @aranciata at Christmas my wish list is board games, as long as the gifter promises to play them with me.
@GeminiJ13 I dunno, the fire units round here seem really responsive. Turned up when someone reported smelling smoke (it was a BBQ)
That fire was in a live/work space near fruitvale station. Literally a block away from a fire station.
@llamasoft_ox have you played around with Space Engine?
@Nurse_Bluheart electrical systems started local and grew outwards,
@Mattophobia Also as a YT 'pro' I'd never stream RB because of Copyright, so I can see it's low priority.
@Mattophobia Gotta admit I liked the Pro-Guitar and; Keyboards option in RB3 - disappointed with the step back.
@Mattophobia I've spent easily over $1000 on this game.
@Mattophobia huge fan. It's the best party game ever.
It looks like You can't buy Pick Up The Pieces any more, but it shows in RB4 store and simply gives an error message @RockBand
@chumprock @RockBand I don't honestly know... something about timelords and tardises. Skye picked it.
I think I have all my @RockBand DLC on my new system... Except the greatest funk tune ever 'Pick Up The Pieces' - I am sad,
@Mattophobia I wait until they go on sale after christmas.
@MrChansco yeah but that 60Hz means that US TV's have that ridiculous 29.97 frame rate, should've picked a sensible number, like, 50.
@PaulDalyROI Still mostly 2 pin, but I use 3 pin where possible.
@DJSnM Although I should point out that this was British standards, and the UK has proper 240V electricity, unlike the wimp 110V in the US.
@Danny_2462 I'm failing at sleeping..... which is of course one reason why I haven't finished shenzhen I/O - need to be alert for that.
@KenspiracyChan No they're 0.75 cal rocket launchers.
Seeing videos of the new Space Hulk game and once again disappointed that they don't make the Bolters sound like a gyrojet.

@MysteryGuitarM still trying to convince the family to see if for the first time :(
@ShujinTribble did you watch the video? I hear lots of people laughed at the captain's log joke.
Interestingly, I believe one of the experiments on the lost Progress was related to making macrobiotics to help with microbiome health.
According to YouTube stats my space poop video is getting 10% of expected views. Maybe @YouTube devs should work it out with a pencil.
@doug_ellison dang, I think it's time to put a 3D printer in my Christmas list.
@AbrahamHanover: Holy shit!Hey, @syfy! Did you see this? I may find something more deeply awesome than this today, but I wouldn't bet
@hankgreen Confirming that I just posted a video about poop in space and it's being ignored, only possible explanation is a sub glitch.
@highlycaffin8ed @donttrythis Now I want a version of this attacking a rocket instead.
@MysteryGuitarM You're just practising for those hollywood suspense endings.
@MojoBeastLP even if the engine just shut down it was sub orbital at the time and would be lost.
@arielwaldman @BenLillie @AMNH hear hear, I know people that started by playing KSP, learned things and; ended up working in space tech.
Actually writing the next science video to get the language right, lots of euphemisms will need to be deployed.
@elonmusk as CEO aren't you supposed to add "don't try this at home kids" just in case someone takes this as inspiration?
@Steam_Spy but a large fraction of those were not fit to be called 'games'.
@Goatie @HeavyHDx @Timmy_Oz if you're going With SSD be sure to start with a PSPro
@rakFAB1 it won't be a series for long if nobody watches
@KerbalSpaceP Besides, I think I'd have an unfair advantage, better to let some less known fans get the limelight.
@KerbalSpaceP No, I was a numpty and didn't end up posting.
@Steejo @YouTube that's fine, it's the other KSP video that I care about.
@stefanvignir Yep, lots of little bits of macOS come directly from NeXTSTEP
@stefanvignir yep, however apple bought nextstep and therefore could keep the trademarked namespaces.

Stats are just backward for me today, new KSP video getting &lt;20k views, 2 day old No Man's Sky video getting 50k.
@IAmTom5Tom @MAGIX_INT I saw complaints that they also removed AC-3 Dolby Digital Pro and some codecs lost CUDA support.
@aviwarner @TechCrunch honestly, I think they missed an opportunity. They could have put the disks on a Bus and called it the DataBus.
@Rainmaker1973 @nyrath I should of course credit Universe Sandbox 2 for this video
@Ian_Tex_Greer I'm not the one to ask about zombie sandboxes, sorry.
@Champion_Songi Yeah I used to do that in the 90's, in the days before ubiquitous video cameras.
@BBCTwo I'm from the U.K., but live in the US does that count?
@DudeJawayJr Livestreams are for goofy stuff, and occasional good ideas.
With the great prop/set design it could fit right into the more mundane end of the Alien universe.
Seriously, people look dismiss Outland because of the ridiculous decompression deaths and miss the fact that it's a great movie.
Having watched Westworld I'm hoping that someone in TV looks at Outland and sees the potential in a TV Series.
@DudeJawayJr I was born in Scotland, and I acted on stage, that's it.
@testedcom if you want a somewhat realistic game with Biplanes then Rise of Flight is the place to be. BF1 is childs play in comparison.

I was first introduced to SAM Simulator on July 4th 2014, never made a video because MH-17 happened and it would be insensitive.
@Rhivre @HLIBIndustry @EveOnline @DrEyjoG when the Noctis launched I was buying more PA than the rest of EVE put together.
@DJSnM (Obviously that's SAM Simulator, because what I wrote suggested simulating what it's like to be someone called Sam)
@NASA Just make sure the programmers learn to reject overflows and unexpected data, don't be like ESA.
@AlanZucconi @Official_GDC @igfest I'd clone the kinesthetic controls NASA tested in 1970, but people confuse it with the Wii Balance Board.
@Mattophobia He is intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking.
@nyrath @Step_Holt Yep - Mt Tambora is estimated to be about 33 gigatonnes equivalent - albeit spread over 3 days.
@SinoCanuck Chinese anthem calls for the workers to build a great wall. How... interesting.
@Step_Holt @nyrath got me thinking: the 1815 Mt Tambora 'Explosion' took 3 days, released energy equal to 10 N-1 explosions *every second*!
@fcain Also, judging by the reflections of the surroundingbuildings, that's a pretty old image.
@xZise @fcain Oh I already know, I regularly walk past it.
@LCS_Big_Mike My Wii runs several old console emulators. Not many old computer games I'd still play though.
@Step_Holt @nyrath It's not the largest human made non-nuclear explosion though, Minor Scale and Misty Picture tests were both 4x larger.

@EveOnline I made my trillions through Insurance fraud, trading, market manipulation and ice miner ganking.
@KasperVld @Kurckje Do you not think that's a bit much just for playing Shenzhen I/O? I mean every other game is inferior so why bother?
@Kenmoron @ObsidianAnt @frontierdev 'Strange Happenings' = people making hundreds of millions per hour.
@arstechnica UNIX on my work machines is required, but boy this thing is heavy, more like a desktop replacement. Also, why only 1080p?
@arstechnica yet another reason why the next space station needs to seriously consider rotating artificial gravity facilities.
@sietskebeakers @ACSReactions exclusivity makes jokes funnier, I fondly remember cracking up over a joke that only 2 people could understand
@LCS_Big_Mike One reason why I still have my PS1, PS2, PS3, XBox360, Nintendo 64, Gamecube (W/Gameboy player) and Wii still hooked up.
@sietskebeakers @ACSReactions 'Atlantis if Stability' one of those hilarious jokes that only a few will get.
@Ekscalybur @washingtonpost was working in one, watch this space (poop).
@dannyBstyle I want to know what @levarburton thinks about this important question.
@Mattophobia @DanNerdCubed after taking away all devices I caught her up late reading Dr Who trivia when she was supposed to be asleep.
@Mattophobia @DanNerdCubed Then again, Skye rewatched every modern Dr Who in the last 2 weeks so I'm afraid of her getting into Trek.
@Mattophobia @DanNerdCubed I'm sorta happy that It's made both my kids want to start watching Star Trek.
@DanNerdCubed I loved the scene, in a non-Trek way. If there were a Red Dwarf feature film that would fit right in.
@mathwizi2005 All that addon does is let you use a 3.5" disk instead of 2.5/9mm hdd.
@mathwizi2005 the PS4 supports 2.5" disks either in conventional spinning platter or SSD form.

@jacobsburley and nobody is developing higher platter density in 2.5" drives because only crap laptops use spinning disks these days.
@8bitadc Have you seen my record collection? nImagine how much space my @RockBand DLC takes?
There are 2.5" HDD's with more than 2 TB, but they don't fit into the 9.5mm enclosure.
Disappointed that in the last 2 years there's been no increase in the max HDD storage possible in a PS4. Still stuck at 2TB

@BadAstronomer @hollyamos22 @MikeOkuda Oddly enough I was considering going to see an aircraft carrier in Alameda.
@Technovelgy @70sscifiart the start to Star Wars was stunning when the rebel ship appeared, then Lucas one upped that moment seconds later.
@Roasdkill Are there any other KSP related numbers?
@Steejo Is this the new easy one or the old, hard one.
@Roasdkill Oh wow! Glad they put in 0.9 because doing that in 1.0 was beyond me.
@Roge_I right but looking at the data let's me guess problem ahead of time and plan for it.
I've spent hours playing around with sandbox, and I do cheat a bit by reading supplemental data off camera.
@AsmodeeDigital my iPhone 6s+ / iOS 10.1.1 gets very hot and loses about 2% charge/min while running Pandemic.
@AsmodeeDigital was glad to pick up Pandemic for iOS but it depletes battery faster than any other app. Is this a known bug?
@verlorenmind analytics suggests that it's a problem that limits subscriber growth.

@GFL_Mercury I have been unable to grab the stick in VR so I gave up.
@xZise @ZachWeiner @BadAstronomer fun fact - Atari was originally going to be called Syzygy but someone beat them to the name.
@moura_101 @AsteroidBase thanks for responding, super busy here with family stuff.
Most likely I'm looking at a new channel which will be 'fun and games' with the main channel being science with the occasional science game.
@Aka_Pcfx Most likely new channel will be created for games, and that'll be the home of a new KSP series.
@SimoRoth I have a follow up that's just me replying to comments....
Given that my science videos are always getting more views than any game videos I think it's time to re-evaluate my channel.
@astVintageSpace @RACThe_Dog @YouTube Indeed, some rocket explosions were literally driven by alcohol.
@RACThe_Dog @astVintageSpace @YouTube it involves exploding rockets.

@FuturamaKing no, rockets can exceed exhaust velocity if &gt;64% of their launch mass is fuel.
@LongHairNasaGuy Yep, but I'm of the opinion if you're developing systems that compare sensors then some paranoia should be built in.
@_Gaeel_ this is something video game level designers need to learn.
@ben_r_hoffman @SarcasticRover @khipsky It was Reagan's idea that NASA should include missions to Earth to provide value to taxpayers.
Back on the one remaining Shattered Horizon server for a little pew pew.
@LledniwsRolyat But I would go with one of the 3 main US brands - Celestron, Orion or Meade
@LledniwsRolyat Reflectors are if you want to optimize and get most aperture for your money.
@LledniwsRolyat I always feel if you want a portable scope then refractors are a better choice, or even a Mak-Cass
@arstechnica if you've got that time off there are many more worthy games.
@sh0v0r lunar flight is light on resources, surprised you never ported it to iOS or Android, although controls are the hard part.
@LledniwsRolyat You're better off looking for a mirror, it's easier to build a dobsonian. I don't have any recommendations though.
Ok thanks to everyone who dropped by Shattered Horizons watch this Space
@DJSnM playing right now in only server I can find
Does anyone out there still have Shattered Horizon? Been wanting to make a video but Multiplayer is dead (understandably).
@MikeHobsonEsq @YouTube thank you for getting the joke.
It's clear to me that some forums discussing the EM Drive are little more than pseudoscience echo chambers. Or rather 'resonant cavities'.
@astVintageSpace am I going about it the wrong way? Writing a book before I try to sell the idea of thebook?
@hws5mp Yeah I have fuel dump mods the question is always whether I have on installed at any particular time.
@beersmartlogic if you allow yourself to exhale ear drums will equalize quickly. Fluids only boil on exposed surfaces. Eyes stay put.
@beersmartlogic lack of oxygen to the brain. Truthfully that's the only thing that will ever kill you.
@MrArchoir did you pause the game right away? It's possible the standard persistence file still exists and hasn't been overwritten.
@DanNerdCubed he's also Prince Phillip in 'The Crown' - Netflix's new series about Queen Elizabeth.
@LCS_Big_Mike it's not a money problem, but a time problem.
@LeiZeroSeven bits of it for sure, but the ship fits have changed over time.
@FuturamaKing @NASAVoyager not sure, Pioneer 10 is 60% cost of Voyager, but not sure of distance.
@astVintageSpace it was from a sounding rocket video which had a mic. Some people misinterpreted, otherstrolled.
@salamanderrake second best superhero movie of the year.
@F9_UHF_antenna @torybruno @ulalaunch I just find it amusing that GOES-R is in an orbit that looks like it Goes nowhere.
Finally got to see Dr Strange - after a meh summer movie schedule the Nov/Dec films are full of things I need to see.
@zatricky it wouldn't be a problem is Chrome had a way for me to select the audio device.
Chrome keeps choosing the wrong sound device and Microsoft Edge keeps crashing grrrrr. Trying firefox next.
@AstroSamantha: Ha...1st time I see a picture of the legendary Baikonur "start key". When they say on the radio "Key on start", it's not
@sh0v0r glad I won't need to use ReVive any more
@sh0v0r: Uploading new Lunar Flight VR Build with Vive Support... stay tuned...
@nite97m @GreatScottLP it seems to do this but haven't yet figured out the experimental error.
@nite97m @GreatScottLP no I made some drunken comments in it saying that I'm glad they're doing the science but still skeptical.
@Jay1701 worse!You can always try him out using a cardboard headset and 360 videos
@hipponanymous Not sure about lighting, but cockpit reflections and caustics are unrealisticly overdone.
@hipponanymous it is alpha, also I hope they'll improve the graphics before release. The characters in Infinite Warfare make SC look old.
@_____Knight____ @AkiranBlade And I'll be happy with my Phoenix. nHope when they inevitably remodel it they keep the hot tub.
@Paulius1981 And if you want multiplayer then Elite: Dangerous covers that. But I couldn't play E:D in VR for hours.
@mweis100 the intention is to support game development this way.
@ReQuiemJAO I certainly wouldn't do it, but there are people who would.
@Paulius1981 This is very true - although there is the option of playing as a team against AI
@wingod Already replied, I'm sort of interested.
@pecisk Yes, but It'll hopefully mean less people getting mad at me when I tell them that update X isn't being released 'soon'.
@empty1388 first and foremost is the business management, how does the lack of a blind trust, not leave a clear conflict of interest?
@RobertsSpaceInd Also happy to see the dates use a sensible format rather than that silly M/D/Y format.
@empty1388 I used to have libertarian principles in the days before I understood the US as a consumer economy.
@empty1388 Any thoughts on the conflicts of interest within the current transition team?
@Eggonaught Not asking you to change politics, just asking you to be honest, seek truth, avoid hipocrisy. Be truthful to yourself and others
@empty1388 certainly not. And I hope you're be unbiased in your calling out of DC corruption in the next few years.
@Eggonaught @empty1388 @google @YouTube Nah I don't watch US media for this reason, I prefer foreign press.
@Eggonaught Just saying that you've been retweeting verifiably wrong headlines. I know you're smarter than that, apply your critical eye.
@wingod Moonbase Alpha is a free NASA funded environment that covers some of this, the KS for the sequel stalled though.
@wingod all genuine, although, there are mods to make it even more realistic.
@empty1388 @google @YouTube Yes, that is indeed a headline I've read on fake news sites.
@wingod That would be a pretty good theme for a KSP series. non-VR though.
@greatistheworld @YouTube Not really, it just makes it bigger. What is special is the majority of content is in video form.
@greatistheworld I work in ML and know a lot about content classification, mistake happen. @YouTube just needs to respond fast when notified
@Eggonaught @google @YouTube Been reading fake news I see.
Remember: @google is suggesting they can stop fake news. Meanwhile @youtube can't even make intelligent decisions about video content.
@Threontai It has real consequences. Besides why use excel? True players write their own number crunching code.
@youtube De-monetized one of my videos on Space combat, presumably because the title mentions drive by shooting with nuclear weapons.
@inwerp Yes I've got it, very cool, but making a fun video eludes me.
@chrisross No, the stories are unrelated, and the battles are simple multiplayer arena events.
Also, while it's cool to fly around all those ships from Eve we never see them firing at each other.
Match based multiplayer lacks the personal investment that the high stakes Eve: Online universe offers.
I do wish Eve: Valkyrie had more single player content. The multiplayer can't hold a candle to Eve: Online's multiplayer.
@Sylon00 Well just be aware, there's likely a steam sale incoming next week... might be some good deals coming.
@Sylon00 Do you have something against buying from the Oculus store? (I know I do)
@perbjoerklund It's better value for money than some VR titles.... but that's not saying a lot. HOTDS is a better bet if cost is a factor.
@Suitonia @mark_wilkins I'd using my PLEX stash to throw a massive pizza party.
After the terribleness of yesterday's Martian VR experience I was glad to have Eve: Valkyrie to offset it.
@eve_scout: Some inspiration for Alpha Clone explorers. My trusty alpha heron hauled in 308 million ISK from a wormhole I was passing th
@steveken @astVintageSpace that's the hard part to decide....
@astVintageSpace Don't be afraid to cut stuff, I'll have a longer edit. It will not be lost to history.
@baserunner0723 Yeah, but it's clearly wrong when they describe ET at the worst game ever, it's not even the worst 2600 game.
@SwiftOnSecurity: HTTPS everything isn't because your comic book history website needs privacy, it needs integrity to prevent injection
@astroneergame: Curious about the games design and what to expect? Watch Jacob play LIVE and answer your questions on @Twitch /SES_dev,
@dciskey @StrongholdGames Haven't tried it, I've got a serious backlog of other stuff to look at before I go buying more stuff.
@Radio_Russell The Action 50 compilation I ended up with was full of things written in BASIC, I learned a lot of code from those.
@Mattophobia You weren't around in the early days of home computers. and VCS crapware, you can't imagine the horror.
People cite E.T. as a worst game ever, but it was coded in 5 weeks and contains some attempt at innovation and flair.
@wednesdaynight Calling the Martian VR experience shovelware makes me realize that they missed an entertaining 'shovelling dirt experience'.
I think The Martian represents some sort of record for the disparity in the quality of the Movie vs Quality of the games.
@TesseractUnfold I get fleeced so you guys don't have to.
@DJSnM At the very least I'd hoped they'd have an option to go full on Desert Bus with the driving.
@jeremiahfelt it's a COPV failure related to the fuel loading process. I hear it's reproducible, but exact details are not public.
@FrankyBabes @Histreepix the problem with such a power source is it's hard to direct it to do anything useful. It crashed soon after launch.
@RichardGarriott @JasonBulmahn @HarperVoyagerUS not gonna lie, visiting those places are high (and low) on the list of things I want to do.
Wish I could spend some of my Eve PLEX to buy @EVEValkyrie - gotta buy it for real money like everyone else.
@EVEValkyrie @CCP_Fozzie @htcvive I know why I'm doing tonight.
@astVintageSpace next time we'll get a better angle on the backup camera.
@legoclone09 @duranduran I hope you know where the name comes from.
@donttrythis This is one of those videos that people will be watching, rewatching and zooming in on for a long time.
This afternoon I am mostly listening to The Ukulele Orchestra, Acid Brass and other reinterpretations of tunes from my youth.
@PixelJanosz @Twitch yeah I don't need games, I need free time.
@Ryan123220 hasn't that already been played out by now?
@cmdr_data I did and I'm trying to figure out why they're choosing to do this via a crowdfunding campaign.
@Volatar I'm more neutral on it compared to the past. Lots of people think I'm out to kill the game (I'm not, only devs can kill the game).
@eyewitness4560 I am as well, but MMO's just keep understating the amount of investment they need.
@II_oxidizer_II @WorldAndScience It is unprofessional! I'm a professional nerd, not a professional video maker.
Crowfall has returned to crowdfunding to raise more money. This is why I don't promoteMMO Kickstarter campaigns.
@TheLonlyGuy_ @Twitch again???? Something OBS must have token
@sahouraxo: Carrying her cat Lulu in her purse, a displaced Iraqi woman safely reaches a checkpoint east of #Mosul after escaping ISIS.
@CloudheadGames: Congratulations to @Alientrap winning Best Educational Game for @ModboxVR at the 2016 #CVAwards!
@dave_korb planetary protection should always be considered
@jesustheplumber @YouTube Vacuum welding, lubrication, and the ergonomics of using one while wearing spacesuit gloves.
@jgranzow Right, they rely on a pressure differential, but I suspect that the difference is high enough not to matter.
@MJLaukala The kind that exist rather than fairy tale energy weapons.
@Dvckstr1k3 It's chromatic aberration because it's a refractor, most likely because I can't hold my smartphone exactly in the middle.
@emmablackery in that case it'll be put on next flight automagically.
@DavidBraben I'm hoping car makers will make it configurable, then I'll make mine sound like my Cobra MKIII
@acarboni @dannyBstyle I'll believe it when I see it, they can't even stop Flat Earth channels showing up as science results on @youtube
@donttrythis @flir That looks like one of the more Pro devices compared with my FLIR One
@TesseractUnfold @PaulOBrien I believe google street view app includes spherical imaging and stitching
@TesseractUnfold @PaulOBrien not sure about apps, but there's hardware that does that.

@bigorangemachin the problem with parabolic flights is they'll still feel aerodynamic drag.
@SurprisingEdge @astVintageSpace Editing this is complicated, but watch this space.
@TheYunners By the looks of the amount of tunnelling - I suspect it's quantum.
@MadFer_It @ratchet34321 @StuR328 @darth_rich @Capita686 @ytevo79 It's Atlas.
@smartereveryday would be fun to do a video testing whether engineers can smell difference between different fuel types.
@BalisongDong someone suggested they might be a good analogue for fluid mechanics, they weren't but they were funny.
@roach I'm glad to see the US is finally catching up with the British in the all important Field of crisp (potato chip) flavored.
@ThyCallHimBrian both aircraft had APU's running.
@jaccovanschaik no these wavelengths get stopped by the glass
@DJ_Sylveon the plane in the last image had just arrived, the close up of the plane engine had been on ground for 30mins.
@stephen_wolfram I love the article, but I have to point out that Voyager 1 passed Pioneer 10 back in 1998.
Negegg have refurbished Phantom 3 drones for just over $300 that's almost an impulse buy... except for the spare time thing.
@SLIMus_Maximus Given that advertising is what encourages me to do youtube It would be hypocritical for me to use that.
This hotel WiFi keeps pushing ads into my browsing, Ads for Astrology services.
@PanzerDusk I've got to say, if that tank was advancing on me like that I would want to switch to their team. Beer not war.
@alikchialeika as someone who studied comets, let me tell you they are complex things.
One thing I notice about LA is there are a lot of billboards advertising TV shows. SF has a rare example, but they're everywhere here.
@Aloisius I guess, Alameda is just a particularly quirky Bay Area city, I love the place.
@Aloisius I know the feeling, data can be so much fun.....
@Aloisius Alameda cluster completely makes sense though, lots of older Ex-Navy vets living there.
@Aloisius Have you de-biased this based on background population density?
@arielwaldman Used to build these as a kid, never knew the mechanism until I went to Uni.
@nyrath Looking at the appendices on asteroids as weapons and I see a number of flaws in their reasoning.
@TheRealBuzzkeep meaning to make a video on the math behind your docking navigation on Gemini 12
@RichardGarriott it's a show called 'Space Center'. Still in development and working on all that dull stuff like funding :)
@RichardGarriott I guess I mean to say it's part of the set, so a prop? I don't know this Hollywood lingo.
@Rainmaker1973 @nyrath @xkcdComic I just did the math and LGM-1, the first discovered pulsar is 6 angstroms. So not much bigger than atoms.
@ThatDearGuy I can barely fly a drone with my hands....
@SonofaBear85 Studio City... actually I'm not sure everyone else is doing he driving.
@TesseractUnfold it's a prop being used as a prop.
@TheOtherDaveS everything is built to be earthquake resistant around here
@Wizarth I had a video of the control surfaces on a 747, wanted to do a video where I explained what they all do.
I kinda wanted a thermal cam image of the plane after landing.
@TheYunners I am serious, and don't call me Shirley
Forgot to download TV shows about plane crashes, so reading Wikipedia pages instead.
@Bisba1 glad we won't ever be fighting over seat preference
I knew the Galaxy 7 was banned from flights, it hadn't really clicked that this meant flyers were reminded of this every 5 mins.
@Banaltweet well you know, red white and blue is only used for a dozen national flags.
@SLIMus_Maximus If a man is uncomfortable shooting hot pink lasers then he's not a real man.
@SpaceScumbag erk - my bad! Sorry - Please everyone let it be known that the creator of this crap is @SpaceScumbag
@ulalaunch: About 5 mins from first CubeSat deployment. #AtlasV #WV4 @NatReconOfc
@arielwaldman: Today is #sciencehackday SF setup day! Really encouraged by all the messages I've been receiving from attendees and; excited
You can mislead people using numbers and statistics, but if you don't provide numbers you can literally make up any crap you want.
The sound on todays Atlas V launch was better than I've heard from almost any launch really glad to hear it.
Wondering what the odds are that this rocket will launch wipe I'm in this tunnel.
@arstechnica this story came too late to ask how users of dial up vote in presidential elections. An interesting statistic I'm sure.
@WolfBaginski BBC is still reliable on politics.
@jaapengel79 The crew were not rendered incapable of walking away right?
@BBCBreaking @BBCNews oh come in 2016, what more do you want from us?????
@Mattophobia @annemijnhoff @cheerskevin @EinsteinReplica @ghostinsanityx @jaecyn42 @OrtensiaOrlandi wait, did you guys just finish?
@ManMadeMoon: Day 24 of @MUTE_Film shoot.Having far too much fun on this movie!Like being on holiday with a bunch of pals. 
@RealDashPlays And yet I'm completely comfortable wearing Kilts, think that Sex and; The City is a great TV show, and have a pink iPhone.
If anyone is ever unsure whether someone online is me then you can always ask me. (Sure, twitter won't verify me, but I'm the real thing)
@WalterSimonson @nyrath the world's first 'everybodyelsie'
@mehka @FinancialTimes yeah, never suggested it was related, just showing that US isn't the center of the universe.
@gateway_louis At this point there aren't any functional in game orgs, because that's an open world thing, 2018 at earliest. Don't sweat it.
@LPCrowther perhaps, but perhaps include the cost per unit mass in the calculation.
@FellipeC Number of robot citizens on other planets is a pretty important number too.
@DJSnM I mean obviously the breweries per capita is a really important number here on top of those duller economic statistics.
@raffitz we already have variations - other countries.
Given the amount of well curated data, someone should put together a scientific measure of national 'greatness' so we can track performance.
@Hugon5_ @dannyBstyle Since Obama came to office the US has had the largest expansion in beer choice in the history of the world.
@LerchTimothy @BagelBoysGotYou @salamanderrake @prageru such a structure exists: congressional districts. Prime target for gerrymandering.
@BagelBoysGotYou @salamanderrake @prageru @LerchTimothy CA, TX and; NY together represent 30% of US GDP and no campaign spends any time there.
@BagelBoysGotYou @salamanderrake @prageru @LerchTimothy well not the main states, the swing states. The sure things get ignored.
@salamanderrake @BagelBoysGotYou @prageru @LerchTimothy you mean like the way the current EC encourages ignoring most states?
@salamanderrake @BagelBoysGotYou @prageru US govt has 2 houses Congress and; Senate for a reason, to give small states more power in senate.
@BagelBoysGotYou @salamanderrake @prageru @LerchTimothy Constitution declares Govt 'For The People By The People'.
@salamanderrake @BagelBoysGotYou @prageru but state level voting *is* via popular vote, they add up all the votes and then assign EC votes.
@salamanderrake @BagelBoysGotYou @prageru Yes you've said that, can you explain why though, saying things doesn't magically make them true.
@salamanderrake @BagelBoysGotYou @prageru can you explain how the electoral college affects cities? It's a state level thing.
@IridiumBoss good luck, hoping for a successful return to flight this year!
@tegiminis Also worth pointing out that there's a glut of MBA graduates who have high rates of underemployment.
@arstechnica @KyleOrl Confirming I still have P.T. on my PS4 HDD.
Was asked whether election affects some big projects, my response was to misquote David Farragut - "Damn the Trumpedos, Full Speed Ahead!"
@_flat_Erik honestly with such low approval ratings he's got to perform miracles to have a chance of a second term. No pressure Donald.
@_flat_Erik easy for me, I have financial security, but I worry for Americans who've helped made the USA great and may face deportation.
@ArsTechnicaUK @arstechnica @Tom_Mendelsohn I agree with her in something I guess.
@CidelWasTaken @Mattophobia @Boogie2988 I'm not American just yet.
@Almost3333 @Rainbowd4sh1 indeed many cornerstones of campaign were anti-Repub - e.g. NAFTA was negotiated under George Bush Sr.
@RealRadarWill a bit of everything, I just like mucking around with all of them.
@MrSamFord trading is based on the flow of capital, and any restrictions on that flow are bad for your business.
@e_downer can't spend more and tax less, without increasing deficit. And how does a friendly congress and; senate help make Mexico pay for wall
@MrSamFord the money will no longer stay in the U.K. It's going elsewhere.
@MrSamFord no they'll still make money if consumers, but the HQ, the core of business will move to other countries in the Eurozone.
@salamanderrake again, not the point I was making.
@dannyBstyle: if donald trump wins, i lose my healthcare, and very real possibility that i can't keep doing what i'm doing for a living.
@MrSamFord but on top of that the Banks and other employers are already moving operations out of U.K.
@ch_amend: Angela Merkel now really is the leader of the free world.
@MrSamFord must have missed all those people complaining about hardware prices and being poor on holiday.
@Runiat just wait until algae blooms and jellyfish become the next big culinary frontier
@DJSnM I mean it's possible they make things better or worse in next 4 years, but many off the cuff 'campaign promises' will never happen.
Truth is, market effects are temporary since Trump was very vague in terms of actual policies. Brexit effect in UK is quantifiable worse.
@MrCellaneous more than one country uses dollars 
@tomfsc24 it's the same place it always was, with all its qualities, and all it's flaws.
@JimorGames you mean people who've read the constitution?
@tomfsc24 the other side is that it only requires enough big states to cooperate, doesn't matter what swing states choose to do.
@The_Tproc greater that it will be in 4 years time.
@tomfsc24 I highlighted this specific one because it doesn't require a constitutional amendment (because that doesn't have a chance)
Canada's immigration website may have crashed, but I'm still going ahead with my US Naturalization. America was Already Great.
@JayGSlater I don't have any detailed analysis, it's just a curious way to fix some problems with US election without amending constitution.
@daslob420swag yeah, it's not about helping Clinton, it's about improving democracy. (Even if it's just a little)
@JayGSlater their specific argument is swing states get 7% more Federal funds per capita.
@cpl_b hell to the yes to some sane RCV mechanic. But that would probably require constitutional change and neither major party wants it.
@ClovenLife to be fair, you can't shift state lines so not sure how you'd gerrymander the electoral college.
@JayGSlater as far as I can tell, there are plenty of urban voters in the swing states.
@Th3angryman @markets in percentage terms it's much smaller, but US economy is bigger.
@WeirdWizardDave while it'll be legal in California I'm sticking to tea and beer
@bill_toney I made no prediction. And there were times Clinton had a lead in EC votes.
@coryman876 depends on whether voters arepersuaded.
So that drop in value of the US dollar represents almost a trillion dollars.
@Skylar152 @markets I'm British, I get screwed by both.
Polls in California close and immediately called for Clinton, no surprise there.
@nite97m Or just heard some of Jill's music and Johnson's foreign policy knowledge.
@spacekookie That's what the mathematicians have been saying for 200 years.....
@Mattophobia I remember flying out of Dublin to the US and having to clear US immigration there, saves turning people back after landing.
3rd party candidates don't seem to be a factor. Johnson had been looking good but lost a lot of support, Stein's numbers are homeopathic.
@CraigBlaylock That has no audio, I need a background feed to listen to while doing real work.
Does anyone have a suggestion for an election feed that doesn't have presenters mispronounce bouncing 'data' all the time?
@GeibelMatthew @MathasGames popular vote is irrelevant. bush lost popular vote in 2000 but still ended up president.
@TesseractUnfold size of state. Is not same as number of people in state.
To those who have never followed a US election, red team always scores lots of points early on.
@Eggonaught in a fit of frustration I started writing missiles guidance software in KSP, should make a video.
@ThomasMoszczuk @AustinOnSocial Lots of wiggle room in the answers. Well except the answer to Q9
@mjc4wilton And I'm disappointed by that whole 2nd law of thermodynamics and speed of light.
@MysteryGuitarM @YouTube OOoh HDR video. will have to find some science that can exploit this.
@bernielomax @rathlord Pioneer anomaly was explained by asymmetric thermal emissions, not new physics.
@rathlord Violates basic physics and because 2 other teams retracted their claims after discovering an experimental error.
@OverworldTheme It's a pretty sad channel to be honest.
My only problem with 'The Expanse' is that that series is intended to air on SyFy and is clearly edited to allow tons of ads.
@LarsSchuFa Right, it would be nice if the people publishing this would read German. But different setup this time, so gotta be a scientist.
@CraigyFerg yay! As a fellow Scottish transplant, I'm disappointed that immigration took too long to process my naturalization application.
@faaaaarck even if it doesn't turn out the be an experimental error it's 50 times weaker than ion thruster, and those can't lift own weight.
@RocketTenor @AleIndustries it's what a brewery looks like through a thermal camera module for my iPhone.
@Drabonn yes, twitter loses a lot of detail on mobile apps
@Tons4583 neither would a thermal camera, it doesn't work through glass.
@Tons4583 @AleIndustries nah, they're a silly indulgence. Beer is a higher priority.

@jmm_1233 I'm pretty sure they've taken them out because it's strong enough to handle a quake.
@wjlafrance not the airport, the transport terminal in Soma : busses and; trains
@Pan_rac Zero gravity has been done, rotating reference frames haven't. Elite is the only game I can think of and it fakes it.
@DJSnM for all the talk of the royal family being unelected, they have more real world practical skills than many elected politicians.
I've been enjoying watching 'The Crown' on Netflix, I was happy they included a scene showing that the Queen was a car mechanic in WWII.
@argontuscreates What idea? I don't see any rotation induced artificial gravity in that video, did you link the wrong one?
@edropple Part of the challenge, that's why I said 'capture'.
@craigperko Would also like to see coriolis forces messing with low velocity ballistics.
If I were to design sci-fi FPS levels there would be fun with rotation, a battle to capture an small O'Neill colony with enemies on ceiling.
@KriJBa yeah, I was specifically thinking in terms of a rapidly rotating surface with no place to stay still. Haestrom is just damn hot.
@SpliterCBb Oh I completely forgot to mention that apparently living in space gives you a russian accent.
Whoever came up with the planetary settings for CoD did some sci-fi research, even if the game's science is bad in general.
@dominictarason I didn't even mention the guns, because I'm barely qualified. Just glad it's not a bunch of ray guns.
@sirjofri sure, it's even possible in the atmosphere or on the ground.
@elonmusk: Playing Amish Paradise in my Tesla
@doug_ellison @astVintageSpace @Backflip25 LES1 is one of oldest transmitting sats, Transit 5-b is a bit older.
@astVintageSpace @Backflip25 @doug_ellison it's an old story. Eventually dead batteries become simple conductors and satellite wakes up.
@helinus the whole story is a build up to the 'biggest car crash in the universe' .I've seen all the modern episodes and gridlock is diff.
@zippomage you're thinking of Gridlock,there's a couple of similarities, but many more differences.
@PhoenixHawk yeah, people living in cars, in this case they're stuck in time so haven't experienced time.
@DJSnM also, the reason for visiting this world is to get Bessie fixed up by best car builders in the universe.
@DJSnM dr can fix machinery and recur those trapped, but will create biggest car crash in the history of universe.
@DJSnM time machinery has broken trapping every commuter on roads for millennia, society collapsed.
@CraigBlaylock there's a story that fits around that, but 140 chars isn't enough.
Skye actually came up with a really good idea for a Dr Who story recently, aplanet with traffic out of temporal phase to stop congestion.
@Cocobean1521 that looks like a VM without any OS installed.
@livewire3791 @RichardGarriott more like 'I've got an extra hour to get them ready for sports'.
@Rainmaker1973 @RichardGarriott and they ended up photographing it with a smartphone camera held up to the eyepiece.
@AdmlBaconStraps @stibbons @objectsgame This looks like my kind of thing.
Anyway, I think my point is that there are probably billions of worlds in the Elite universe with this kind of error. #elitedangerous
So, unless the moon is a recent capture the world should be tidally locked to the moon and have an 8 hour day. /5
But it has a moon with an 8 hour orbit, and the tidal forces from that moon are 40x higher than from the brown dwarf. /4
The world is tidally locked to a brown dwarf, which drives the 6.9 day rotation. 3/
But I did the math and I think the rotation rate is wrong and @frontierdev have an error in stellar forge. /2
Ancient ruins in Elite are on world with 6.9 day rotation meaning people visiting at weekends experience night right now. #elitedangerous
@tipul was pretty proud when I figured out how to optimize the signal generator to use1 line of code.
@tipul I think I'm getting better faster than the puzzles are getting harder.
@tipul had a good run this morning, solved Target Illuminator, Killswitch and; Scale in 25 minutes.
Looks like i'm not going to make it to Day of The Devs because of family stuff. Ahh well.
@JGamesPC Oh I was doing stuff, it was running in the background
@SurprisingEdge I just made it up as I went along
@astVintageSpace @doug_ellison @cirquelar I should simulate that - try flying a plane with no controls by moving passengers around.
@doug_ellison @cirquelar @astVintageSpace There's at least one known case of too many fat people at the rear of a plane causing a crash.
Logged into Elite and found the star low on the horizon at the ruins, so I'm parked there (in solo) to get a timelapse of star set.
@Tyler_Hibbard yes, that's where I started using it.
@ToseNikolov I'm pretty sure they calculated many different metrics. They just picked one to put in the headline.
I'm kinda disappointed that the Shuttle and; ISS never hi-fived each other using their arms.
It's funny hearing characters in Infinite Warfare advising each other to fly safe. (not that I'm claiming responsibility, I didn't coin it)
@HeavyHDx It's those other manufacturers that are pushing prices down on android and making it hard to be profitable.
@SnowyDuffield gameplay is always more important than realism, but frequently you don't need to sacrifice realism.
Haven't seen the whole thing but I won't be surprised if there's a firefight on a large ship breaking up during reentry.
@DJSnM Not that I was ever going have the time to put this together....
The more I watch COD campaign set pieces, the more I wonder if someone has taken all the ideas I had for this kind of game.
People have been living on ISS for 16 years. Some parts of the ISS are older than Mir when it was deorbited.
@DanTwoHundred @DavidBraben @InfinityWard @CallofDuty but more brainy though, never a bad thing.
@DavidBraben @InfinityWard @CallofDuty it's like a Michael Bay sci fi action movie. Will make jokes about the bad science while enjoying it.
@mweis100 technology is only getting cheaper. The raw materials are relatively cheap, it's the production line that drives early cost.
@TomWrightGuitar @elonmusk if SpaceX needs a rover I expect Tesla might have a chance.
@elonmusk looks stunning, but I'm curious as to how heavy this is, Lunar Excursion Module design was driven by weight of glass.
@elonmusk: I highly recommend the new all glass roof on the Model S. This was very hard to develop, but it makes the interior feel amazi
@DavidBraben: Welcome to space to the @InfinityWard team and @CallofDuty #InfiniteWarfare - looking forward to playing it!
@rdanielkelemen: Editors of @Telegraph might want to ask (fired) colleagues in Hungary or Turkey what its like to run a paper in country
@TheRealKaivik not a new idea. Call me back when someone makes it work.
@Vault110 very common in KSP aircraft due to people not understanding levers and fulcrums.
@DJSnM assuming a 2x2 meter door and less than full pressure.
In COD There's a scene where they push open an airlock door with atmosphere on other side - that would be 20 tons of air pressure.
@jeffrichards I can't speak for the military, guns or anything... but hey the space sequences still look epic.
@DJSnM and living in space seems to give people russian accents.
@DJSnM But clearly 21st century IOT builder got into the anti Aircraft gun business.
Well I'm watching other people play COD and it looks fun enough, but maybe I'll just make a video about the bad science.
@MichaelLadner1 Oh I'm writing it regardless, it's all about rockets and how one engineer's crazy plan is another engineer's solution.
@MikeLeWatt Does it let you fly spaceships? Because if not, I'm not interested.
@Cruel_Coppinger I did try to get a key but I'm not famous enough for that, probably don't swear enough on camera.
@KabutorEsDday Yeah but all I care about is Bi-Planes and for that I already have Rise of Flight.
@DJSnM I mean sometimes I just want that kind of thing. Will probably just wait to see what other people think.
Still wondering whether I should buy Infinite Warfare just to see how the campaign works. I don't care for multiplayer.
@CCPQuant: Here it is folks, last economic report before Clone State Alpha makes me have to re-define simple things like active isk#tw
@KerbalSpaceP Ahh yes, poor Joegar, I knew him well for about 5 minutes. Still he took the first bold step toconquering the stars.
@kd7uiy nobody has ever been able to work on my schedule.
@0wynd I don't really want to repeat things I've already done....
@EpsenSvendsen It'll probably be a heavily edited highlights reel.
@steboost plenty of plans, but can't reconcile the time needed with my day job.
@rrfarmer I have no lack of previews, but I don't think my audience cares about games so much.
@kd7uiy Board game videos require players and my kids aren't great opponents
So yeah, pretty much stuck in a non-productive rut right now.
Wanted to finish posting all my Children of A Dead Earth and; Shenzhen I/O videos, but realised nobody watches those.
Started writing a book, then realised this isn't going to be ready in time for christmas.
Wanted to start new serious KSP series, but realised all the mods I wantare broken with 1.2.1.
Wanted to make an update on the fantastic 'House Of The Dying Sun' only to realise I am bad at that game.
@tychoc I still think that Opportunity should drop everything and drive to the crater.
@DrummerBoy2112 @compoundchem What concentration does the ethanol have to be? Can we make cocktails like this?
@Danny_2462 wait you mean I should be DMCA'ing half the good KSP videos because they clearly copied me?
@EnterElysium: Any Google/YouTube peeps or contacts out there? @Danny_2462 is in need - has a messed up claim from a rando + needs help
@Danny_2462: Guy's reason for taking down my video is that he did a similar thing in KSP.nI guess I should check every KSP video ever be
@DavidBraben @WorldAndScience there was a paper that puts a telescope at 500AU and uses the sun for lensing. It works on paper....
@willie88498168 @Ometz42 yeah now I can get back to trying to figure out a mod setup that works....
@Ometz42 I too remember that moment, my wife's family is from Boston.
@NickBMorgan Indeed, there were only 8 planets. So nothing has really changed on that front.
@Motochen more than 25% of MLB players come from outside North America.....
The last time the Cubs won the World Series astronomers though Alpha Centauri was the closest star to the Sun.
The last time the cubs won the World Series was back before Rutherford had discovered the structure of atoms.
The last time the cubs won the World Series was just before Halley's Comet visit... in 1909
@LonelyProbe: #FakeCubsFactsnnThe light from the Big Bang was still in visible wavelengths the last time the Cubs won the world series

@jesustheplumber well all the same, if I get asked that question in my civics exam I'm going to use the answer they'll accept as correct.
@jesustheplumber Not even in any of the 4 amendments?
@jesustheplumber I'm pretty sure if you said that in the US Immigration Civics test that would be a wrong answer.
@jesustheplumber In an ideal world, but there's enough well documented cases where it's not. Constitution doesn't specify ID requirements.
@Flacwby @RichardGarriott Show ID, not necessarily Photo ID. That is legal and the law. #pleasereadbeforeposting

@ItsHojoz @steam_games because it's a schmaltzy lifetime movies story told in 16 bit RPG maker style. Some men are uncomfortable with this.
@steam_games I really love this game. But I completely understand that 90% of my fans probably won's.
@AkiranBlade Both attempts to create free societies without government restrictions. One has yet to happen, the other is a legal mess.
@AkiranBlade Given that Seasteading and Galt's Gulch haven't been successful yet I'm not going to hold my breath for a space based version.
@FuturamaKing @hankgreen my son is Orion, different name.
@doug_ellison @katrobison You have this power over robots. When the robot revolution comes you will speak for humanity.
@DJSnM I get their kids a history lesson, parents loved it, kids wanted to move on to next house for more candy.
A parent told their kids I was dressed as a Tuskegee airman, I told them it was an honor to be associated with such distinguished pilots.
@doug_ellison: The #KeyMission360 is just as bad as the reviews. Do not buy.Sending mine straight back to Amazon.
@doug_ellison you can borrow my Theta S any time.
@Cocobean1521 you know how to message me via YouTube right?
@doug_ellison I was wondering if there was a raw mode that would let me do the stitching in my own software, but I've had enough.
@astVintageSpace @AeroEngineer16 this is why I haven't given up my day job. (Well, that and the fact I love my day job)

@iamclintmansell It's a rare moment when my love of vinyl, chiptune and Clint Mansell scores come together in the same place.
@crypticsea early data shows it's successful in Berkely, with the principle negative impact being retailers near the Oakland city line.
@crypticsea I'd be more prepared to listen to their arguments if they hadn't rebranded the soda tax as a grocery tax.
@smartereveryday @periodicvideos My kids keep asking me to get LN2 for science experiments, but more likely they want to make ice cream.
@d3rrial LPDDR is usually used in phones and tablets, although the Surface Pro also uses it.
@d3rrial Try reading about LPDDR standard first before claiming to know how hardware works.
@doug_ellison If I knew there was an imminent software update that would fix its numerous problems I'd keep it, but I'm not hopeful.
One of the downsides of having the physical Shenzhen I/O manual is that the patches need me to print new pages.

@KBrodzky Surprised you haven't had threatening messages from some sellers, I used to get them because I'd do LTI conversions for free.
@KBrodzky @VICE I have now, and if there's anyone skeptical about this, I can corroborate the nature of the SC Gray market.
So the rotation period of the moon with the Alien Ruins in Elite is 6.9 days so don't bother visiting for a couple of days or it'l be dark.
@felix_maxwell but I want to show off the ground!
@EdEvdg but in KSP you can accelerate time, in Elite you might have to wait hours.
One problem about sightseeing in Elite is that half the time you arrive at your destination to find that it's night time.
@cuddledave yes, editing video right now...... hours of the stuff I need to cut down
@arielwaldman I too get plenty of comments calling me a cheerleader who knows nothing.
@SLIMus_Maximus clearly you can't handle the Kraken

@KriLL3 it's essential in 360 cameras because you really can't trigger them with buttons on the device
@Fovulonkiin @YouTube I would buy their camera if it supported iOS
@Brian_Easty @JSdevries been a lifelong Nikon user too. Their hardware is always solid. But I guess with 360 you need perfect software.
@nyrath @torchships but none of the tech in COADE lets you make torchships. Although.... mods may happen.
@ArtOfAstronomy: . , . " !"nLeonov and Sokolov "Here we go!"nWonderful colour and movement here!n#spaceart#spa
@doug_ellison honestly, if Ricoh upgraded the Theta hardware to handle 4K video I'd jump at that. The stitching on the Theta is still best.
@doug_ellison as I understand it, it can be controlled using google's open spherical camera standard. I looked into it a while back.
@doug_ellison Also, I'll point out that I've only been about to get 4kat 24FPS not sure if that makes a difference.
@humble @DoubleFine @iam8bit I like the VIP ticket, but I need to buy it 3 times for me + kids.
@doug_ellison Have you looked at the Samsung Gear 360?
@MattJMangan And obviously the still photos make no sense if you can't take them remotely.
@MattJMangan You can record video like that, but you need to connect to it at least once so you can unset potato quality video option.
Managed to get one phone talking to it and take a picture, so I go to take it outside, unplug it from power and now it's stopped responding.
@JSdevries Probably, but in this case it's Nikon's software that's failing.
When I read hardware reviews and I see people having software problems I usually assume it's the people rather than the hardware.
@doug_ellison Software is still awful I found one device that will pair, but after pairing it can't access anything.
@doug_ellison Aha, good point, it's running while attached to my power brick, just not when laptop is connected. Who's dumb idea was that...
Really disappointed in the Keymission so far, usually @NikonUSA make great hardware, but I can't even test it because software is failing.
@DJSnM Also when plugged into USB the camera functions appear to be disabled so it's no good for recording really long things.
Looks like the reviews complaining about technical problems with Nikon's Keymission 360 are right. None of my 4 phones will pair with it.
@nyrath I never saw any evidence of EMP from Cheylabinsk,nWould take this with a pinch of salt.
@ThePalverZ I hear it has blind spots and won't do closeups as well as the theta.
@ThePalverZ Haven't tried it yet, but I hope it's better than the Ricoh Theta S

Awesome stream today guys, really happy with the lower tier buffs for the germans. See you monday, enjoy your weekend! :D
Going to be 15-30 min late, finishing up dinner! :D
@FPSheep That's awesome! Thanks for the support you 2! ^^
@echo_hell @FPSheep Awesome! Thanks for the support you 2 :)
@eeelliottttt yeah always is with the american one for some reason 4Head
@eeelliottttt How did the graphic on the back turn out?
@josesalle Why are you even commenting, you dont even follow me on twitter and i am not using any hashtags x)
Playing ST-I today, every game that has arty in it, was a deadlock and absolutely no fun. EVERY. GAME. WITH. ARTY. FOR. HOURS.
@DylanGambrel1Nice one! :D Thanks for that support mang &lt;3
Pretty sure its because i;ve cut out a lot of sugar and caffeine from my diet, so hopefully this wont happen to often. &lt;3
Had to call the stream 1h early, headeache got in the way! Either way an AWESOME stream today. Back tomorrow at 12:00CET with Shadow Warrior
This Nioh game looks right up my alley. Finally a game to look forward to! :D Might have to get this capture card... ^^
@_Ectar @worldoftanks It's hard to know this when you dont play your own game :^)
@mikelzinga @teespring Thanks! I think its one of the best merch ive sold :D
@unitlostgaming You been out of the loop then? I thought you where pretty big on warhammer ^^
Am i blind, or is there no simple stats in the garage anymore on PTR?
@Battle_Lamia I like the imperial shuttles and walkers the most, but the tie fighter variants are dope. Thanks again man &lt;3
So tired of arty and the arty players in #worldoftanks :(
@AppTux nice score, arty in platoon tho... :&lt;
@The_Extractor_ 5 man platoons in general are hilariously bad idea x)
@The_Extractor_ Haha, well its to pay for the chieftain i guess!
@SirMavane Sorry dude, it ran for nearly a month, i cant help you out after the fact. Again, i'm sorry. :)
Im outside gong to the barber :O dunno when stream is live today, ill keep you posted!
@Jaw5um: I'm gonna take a quick shower, then I'll stream some art until @SirCircon is back to play HotS! Have a sore throat, forgive cou
Hey everyone, feeling a lot better then last nights extreme headeache. But i'm taking the day off just to be sure &lt;3 See you tomorrow!
@Wargaming_netEN: Want to have your #WoT replay featured by one of our fantastic community contributors!? Send it to @SirCircon for a sh
Reminder; still looking for good current patch wot replays! #Worldoftanks
@_Ectar the acc nerf is retarded. Just make give some tanks (meds) worse acc. Dont nerf acc across the board again.
I figure i'd get a @GreenManGaming partnership going, so i signed up to the Content Creator Affiliate Scheme. Hoping to hear back soon! :)
Uploading another replay-cast! On the channel in 15-30minutes! &lt;3 #WorldOfTanks
@_Ectar rumours of a traditional pkmn game got me sorta hyped.
Reminder, no stream today, heading back to norway! Prob. Longer WoT stream tomorrow. Youtube vid is up later today!
@unitlostgaming Those are some of the more intresting paths to take tho! Very fun to combine twitch and; youtube! ^^
Reminder flying back to NL today. Back streaming tomorrow (friday)
Thanks for tuning into the stream today, 600 viewers for battlefield 1 and i had an awesome time! :D
Btw @Jaw5um and me are playing The Town of Light tonight as a extra new years stream till 00:00 :) some kind of horror game :O
@content808 Thanks, yeah got really unlucky at times. Glad we fought on and won in the end! :D
@t_beightonbacon NO idea, just blue screened, rebooted and its fine.
@eeelliottttt Im saying that ofcourse you get more on a sunday.
@eeelliottttt Because its a regular day to celibrate subs on a sunday so people are off work.
@eeelliottttt Because a lot of plebs leave if they can interact.
@GTThrawn Will be doing a stream, probably some kind of horror-ish game is the plan atm. :)
Heroes of the Storm is really fun. Hope you guys enjoyed the stream, see you tomorrow with #WorldofTanks
@PaleBlueDotBen Get the 3$ one and dont buy in bulk.I think it helps if you dont have a lot of prem ships.
@Cm1994gaming Thanks for the Styrr btw. Im sure ill enjoy the 2 games i play to ace it. &lt;3
@GTThrawn Thats very odd, do you have all the ships you can get from the 3$ one? Because you wont get doubles.
I think the 3$ boxes are probably your best bet from what i've read on reddit. UNless you own like all prem ships.
Its still basicly gambling but eh, i wanted a nicolai since forever. Dont be dumb like me hah ^^
These rewards are soooooooooooooooooooo much better then World of Tanks its crazy
Bought 5 containers in #WorldofWarships got 4 Blyskawicas LOL (trying to get the tier4 battleship) (Feel free to gift me santas boxes ;)
@Thehagengnome no benefits over normal donations, now there is several extras.
@eeelliottttt are these the vids you make nowadays? ;)
@Irelandmann244 grats mate. How hard was it? Not to bad i reckon
Uncertain about streaming times today, probably a short stream in 1 to 2 hours, till about 5-6? Ill keep you posted. &lt;3
@tanksgg Thanks a ton, keep up the good work mate! &lt;3
Hey @tanksgg how doi make my vids show up on your frontpage?
probably streaming a little bit earlier today. 15:00 or so! :)
@Duarte_Teixeira what are the Tank Ace Tanks any more info?
@Jaw5um @Wargaming_netEN hah and this is an old one aswell, paint ftw ;)
@Iiamparker i just fixed one myself, from russiaaaah thanks tho!
@Iiamparker uploaderino to mediafire or something : &gt;
starting at between 12:30 and 13:00 today. Finishing advent + upload and uploading the swedish tier 2-6 aces to youtube. &lt;3
Anyone already have a working servercross2? :&gt;
@galffy tbh, my biggest gripe is that they nerfed the tier 7s.
Still kinda suprised the SWE Tanks got released this early. By the state of it another balance pass would have been good. #WorldofTanks
@chef_hoyle Probably? but i cant watch the previous patch replays now :(
@PeterNWard Thats what i normally do, but it auto updated in the background.
@imastalker15 Its hit or miss, some do, some dont.
The only thing i dont like about updates, is that it fucks with the old replays. UGH.
Just going to finish the advent calendar vid then live with battlefield 1 with @Jaw5um and; @sn00ze81 :)
@Thehagengnome just went up, i was flying to norway so its a bit late.
Probably no stream tonight. Had a rough night and i dont want to over do it.
Glad i stopped the stream, by god. I had to puke like 2 liters #killme
If i do stream tomorrow, i might do WoT to make up for today.
Hate calling a stream early, but i feel like complete trash atm. Ill keep you posted for tomorrow stream. &lt;3
Still traveling home, not streaming today. Will make advent calendar vid tho. #WorldofTanks #circon see you tomorrow 17:00CET
@mikelzinga Got a close up of the last one, super curious how is it? :D
Hope @Wargaming_netEN @worldoftanks has a good cyber monday sale for PC to make up for the useless black friday sale. #WorldofTanks
@sn00ze81 nice the shotgun is filled awell 
@sn00ze81 id sleep walk and still win. Like always ;)
@SirFoch i am!Just need to get to the damn airport hah
Already on bus numbah two for the day, omw from norway to sweden to meet you people at the swedish tank museum!
@SirFoch already on my second bus of the day. Rip
@SirCircon 5 hours of this would kill the average joe. Tup Kuk.
Calling it 2 hours early before i get way to tilted/salty. To much arty focus in 9 out of 10 games. See you saturday in sweden! &lt;3
@BrandonBeck93 @PHJ_Official look into this plox
@Crumblator the bundle is only 58000 gold comrade
@RobinLafontaine Highly likely, the main thing i am lacking in WoT is any form of content so. :)
@tarv28 Horrible tank btw, dont even buy it for a laugh.
@mikelzinga Haha, i had fun making fun of that movie xD
@h3h3productions: if you think @MELANIATRUMP 's first act as first lady should be making a video saying "Wow Ethan, great moves! Keep
@San4311 @worldoftanks Its hilarious because @worldoftanks is a global handle and @Wargaming_netEN is EU. NA should have @Wargaming_netNA xD
Listening to a lot of artic monkeys lately. So good. Still. #cryinglightning
Hope all my CIRC FAM is alright in New Zealand. Hope you guys are okay! ^^
@Golem501 thats not with pubs and cant stronghold have arty also not smaller maps?
I cracked the code. I know what we need. A seperate Blitz mode q for WoT pc. 7 v 7 small maps, no arty.
@_Ectar i dont mind the silly skins, but they should always also offer them without it. :)
@BountyHunter84_ Im not using mods atm. Well, only servercross2. :)
@Snipe_00 Eh, i believe that is the biggest size yeah and its US.
Going to be 15 min or so late. Just have to take care of some things. :)
@LAGTVNovaWar Break the shield so that every tier ads a piece and 12 months is full shield and 24 is OP colour shield.
Running a bit late, ill need like 10 more minutes or so, probably going BF1 memes
Are there any EU CIRC people max level in the current D3 season? Didnt want to bother, but i kinda want the cosmetic items. :)
Thanks everyone for tuning in! I realllllly tried today, hope it showed. &lt;3
Watches OW tourny - Wow, i cant wait to play again. Solo Q Ranked at 3100 - 2 leavers and toxicity. WHY :( :( #overwatch
Not even a necromancer can resurrect this franchise. I dont want to do the same old content with a new class #diablo
@pantertigar its already out in RU and already being buffed aswell ^^
Today was not my day. But there is always tomorrow! Goodnight &lt;3
Having some Driver issues and for some reason battlefield 1 is hogging 80%CPU atm. Hang on :)
@PhlyDaily Sure dawg, if you dont mind the latency!
Alrighty, got home, time to download BF1 (1hish) and redo my OBS here. Live in roughly 1h30min. &lt;3
@tielknight atleast my plane had content. My lugage.
Alot of delays on my flight back, will stream when able.
Getting artied every single game, thanks @worldoftanks &lt;3 Amazing job, great special! #triggered
All these halloween modes in games, but the scariest off all, is the regular weekend special for Arty in #worldoftanks why. the. fuck.
Trying to go live, but OBS doenst seem to pick up BF1?!
@DezGamez Thanks Dez,if you wanna play later in the night, just hop on TS :)
@sn00ze81 haha, you have to get better! There is 'fun' to be had friday ;)
@sn00ze81 rip, can i have your gear? Get well soon mate!
@TheBeardGuys I mean, if a lot of people liked watching console on twitch, it would just be bigger in the WoT directory and you wouldnt
@TheBeardGuys And that is a large part of how people get to watch the games they do. No one scrolls past the first 20 or so.
@TheBeardGuys This is more because the viewership on WoT twitch is pretty stagnant. Viewers switch channels, but WoT doenst gain a lot 1/3
Rammstein and pokemon yellow on a flight to norway #adult ^^
@johndbro1 not at all, my logo is my name: circonflexe = ^ circonflexes = ^^ n :)
@ArmoredWar Dont think i can make that one, but i did try the PTR and i look forward to playing the Global Operations on live! ^^
Reminder Schedule this week: n18-10: no streamn19-10: World of Tanksn20-10: no stream n21-10: 12:00 36H WoT startn22-10: 00:00 36H WoT end
@ConradSwart Way ahead of you, fuck yeah i am! :D
@lukebar04313783 I cant do anything about that man, im sorry.
@RobinLafontaine twitch doenst have a upload for that, 2 years is the last elbme you can upload
@BlizzardCS I just checked and its still in q. Kinda weird since its an digital item...
@BlizzardCS I think i figured it out, for some reason the EU ticket is still in queue, even tho its a digital purchase.
Why does the EU virtual ticket not count for the blizzcon pre sale? @BlizzardCSEU_EN @BlizzardCS It says i need a NA virtual ticket?!
The #overwatch halloween update is cool! Brawl is ok, skins are great! Wish for a new map instead of a reskin, but cant have it all! :)
@eeelliottttt YOU FUCKING IDIOT. THAT SHOULD BE YOUR NAME _IIIDIOTTTTTT_ ECKSDEE
@tielknight noticed! also halloween skins nlooking good :&gt; loving the uzi
@San4311 I think youtube video caught on, i got a bunch more offstream :)
@SirFoch: Reminder: Tomorrow. 1400EEST. 30 Hours. Be There.
@TheBeardGuys @WoTConsole @PHJ_Official @SofiGaming Its the one tank line WG should have never implemented.
@TheBeardGuys @WoTConsole @PHJ_Official @SofiGaming OI is OP and the only one worth a single fuck
@TrevorClark22 Yes, the premium is, the tech tree is probably next patch.
Just recorded the first ace game for the new prem tank, its a stomp but will showcase the tank at tier 6, so it can help you decide to getit
@IvanKashperuk You can spend free exp to crew exp. I did this during a weekend special where it was twice as good a value. :)
Also, i need your help, someone please find me a mod that allows freecam in replays. :&gt; #WorldofTanks
Got new and different router. It might take couple hours for internet to work on it apparently. Hope it works before stream
Router update, might be able to get a new one today at the store. Traveling my arse off today. Hope it works out!
As you might have guessed, no stream today, the delay from faulty router is a bit to much. Back tomorrow with maybe WoT.
Came home to a broken router, new one inc on friday... Maybe store has one earlier. Now on 2nd internet shared with 2 roomies. hope it works
Playing pokemon yellow and listening to mastodon/PUSA on the flight back. #likeaboss
Peaches come from an can, they where put there by a man, in a factoryyyyy downnnnn townnnnn #PUSA
I will make a video on it when im back home. Really hoping to hit the next tier of sub emotes so we get 5 more emotes!!! :D
@denjamesm I sure will, thanks for the reminder. &lt;3
@GTThrawn pretty meh patch tho, no swe line yet!
@Jaw5um @sn00ze81 Yeah sn00ze come visit sometime :&gt;
@sn00ze81last hours where good!have fun mate! We should try divinity at some point
Thanks for watching today everyone, goodluck out there with the t-44-100 missions, its rough teams ^^ #CIRC
Reminder: I'm in Norway starting today till oct 2nd. Streaming from here as per schedule. But TUESDAYS and THURSDAYS will during the day! &lt;3
@LMR_Mad_Friday Enjoy your Waffle E-100 and unnerfed deathstar tho ;-)
@talkingtanks Not at all. Purely playing with controller is a world of difference.
@UnholyMoses @_Ectar Nah not at all, just a different team working on it. Combined with wargaming notorious lack of communication.
@UnholyMoses @_Ectar Obviously stuff like that and i think unnerfed deathstar pen are also the toppest of keks.
@UnholyMoses @_Ectar The point is not only the chieftain, but the complete and utter lack of communication between all the offices.
@talkingtanks I would if the gameplay was as good as on PC. I'm not switching for prettier graphics. :)
@_Ectar Loooooooooooooooooooool. Guess it helps that console has non RU development team. #stubbornrussians
@_Ectar i think thats what they did on console. You can get both from the Conq.not sure.
I'm so glad that World of Tanks and WoT Console are working so closely together. OH WAIT, WoTPC cant even get EU and NA to work together :^)
@Battlefield2020 With good reason, we've been asking for the chieftain since the UK heavy line came out.
@AvoidedDoughnut Sorry mate, i usually dont like stuff like this at all. :)
Hopefully WoT will actually be fun on friday. Thanks for tuning in :) Peace!
@crash_core @Wargaming_netEN Nah, you would be a billionaire. Luckily more people realise that its dumb as fuck and arent assholes :^)
The Brotherman Bill is the brother with the Brotherman Bill skills.
@eeelliottttt Half the stream is streaming. OpieOP
@_Ectar Yeah but engineering was never about making money, always about mostly useless gadgets and nice upgradeble goggles :&gt;
@_Ectar Engineering is always a money sink since the dawn of time.
@Max_SRG @AdrianKing1 Ehhhh finally the proper glass, i got 2 of those :D
Just checking what you guys wanna see tonight, i'm not sure yet:
@tommy_antonsen Remind me when im back from vacation. Ill have a chat with the twitch staff i know directly. Sorry that i cant help rightnow
@DucTapeNinja Yeah i already did placements on ptr this weekend, was almost 3400. PTR OW is a lot better already.
@eeelliottttt @Gleneagleshotel rich guys problems smh
#overwatch season 1 ended. Already wondering why i cant practise with ranked rules in off season. RIP
@tommy_antonsen Thats really weird @misterslin you know more?
Re watching John Wick on netflix, man that movie is so good.
I'm OUTSIDE if i dont make it back and stream, tell billy to go fuck himself. #lastwish
@SirFoch i cant wait for the T57 HD SandBox Live Reviews :P
@San4311 Ill probably check out the german BBs when they come out, i dont haveaboat i really want atm :)
I have NO idea what to play, i might just chill in D3 seasonal and just listen some tunes and talk to the chat :D
@Nyctism Vert Stab Rammer Optics, it has really good viewrange already and you can easily peak hills with the turret to get spotting.
I really wanna roll mage in legion, but super affraid of not having tanks/healers for 5 mans etc. Damn!
won all my late night OW ranked games, almost rank 63 now :D #Overwatch
@unitlostgaming TBH its really tough to find like minded people in OW comp and quickplay is pretty terrible. We cant all be famous :P
@unitlostgaming how many compgames have you won in total?
Holy sweet baby jesus christ fuck me sideways. Fire Mage is amazing now. I feel like rolling that for legion, then its like LF Tank 24/7 :(
#heartstone my predictions besides the obvious _karazhan_ is deathknight class and 2v2 mode.
@tielknight It _can_ be the most fun game ever! :D
@mikelzinga @eeelliottttt Actual shots fired :^)
Another great day of overwatch, deranked 3 times all the way to 54 :^) See you tomorrow for some WoT. :)
@Jaydawg1973 @Wargaming_netEN @worldoftanks by spending to much time on your pc. ;)
Good to see 1500 of you tuning in today. See you tomorrow for memes and friday for more World of Tanks dont forget to checkout my youtube!:D
Cant stand OW without a 6 stack, but i wont find people unless i play. catch22 yay. #Overwatch
Apparently ELO hell is everything below rank 60. #Overwatch
I really want to like OW competitive but no one uses voice, people in general are being dicks. (only at rank 56 atm tho.)
@Pegguins It is a grindfest, however it is adjusted for the western market. I personally really like it, been playing since launch.
@BassGuitarPanda Vk.B is the way to go. Farm tier 7-8 idiots for bounces wilst taking out the enemy tier 9.
Sidenote, the BDO patch is really cool, love the 2 new classes.
Absolutely LOVE the new @PlayOverwatch PATCH! Every hero is viable now, GG !!
@unitlostgaming TBH i hope they keep it this way.
@ankitkothari82 yeah thats how i've been playing last couple of days. But i see way less pokemon then others in the same area it seems
@iMrMalibuZ @mikelzinga i went out form 12:30 till 15:00 today, middle of a city + parks, caught like 7 pokemon. Lel
Wait a minute, #pokemonGo is not in my Play Store ....... .. . .. .. .. .. ?
@mikelzinga T_T I am starting to think i am playing some fucked up version. &lt;_&lt;
I'm starting to think incense and lure modules are fucking placebo items. No spawn in 20 minutes standing in the lure module #pokemongo
@PaleBlueDotBen It's still only as a package deal, that isnt something we should encourage ^^
FYI: COLLECTOR'S GEM: TYPE 62 is _NOT_ worth it. #worldoftanks
@OxyOfficial @MANvsGAME @Amanda_Defrance I still like the game, but there not making it easy ;)
@OxyOfficial @MANvsGAME @Amanda_Defrance In the netherlands, its pretty horrid. I dont hear as many complaints from US people in my chat.
Just as a last check, anyone willing to run my pleb arse through the gold challenge mode 5 mans tomorrow? #WoW #WorldofWarcraft
@Pegguins I dunno ill check my classes once the changes hit, probably frost dk as always.
@OxyOfficial @MANvsGAME @Amanda_Defrance To bad the servers are always down and then when they are not i have to reset the app every 5 min.
Rough night! Still finished the 12T in time! No idea what im playing tomorrow, but ill see you then! Goodnight :D
@sn00ze81 I dunno man, i feel like the servers are just fucked 24/7 i have to restart my app every 5 minutes
@sn00ze81 HOW? Even with incense, nothing ever spawns in my room lmao
@Max_SRG @sn00ze81 @Murphy1up Valor = red = tomatoes,So obviously #Teammystic
@mikelzinga i am trying to play OW but it seems broken, will re install right now
@mikelzinga I dunno dude, it did actually release, but servers are rip so mayby app store aswell xD
Pretty sure canada just blew up the #PokemonGO servers #RIP
@RLewisReports: Just what is the relationship between streamer Phantomlord and CSGOShuffle? New logs suggests more than meets he eye htt
@Alley_gatorZZ Cool photos man! Thanks for sharing! :D
@sn00ze81 Why did you kill the pokemongo server? NotLikeThis
@versitonic Is the military fighting for distribution rights for your new album or wth is going on?
Been checking out the new OW character, really cool!
@GingesLife @Max_SRG Behaahah serious, what a time to be alive.
@SirCircon Will slowly add thumbnails to them aswell o/
Thanks for hanging out today guys, another fun WoT stream. We are on a streak now. Damn. Special thanks to @DezGamez for joining me tonight!
@kappaccin_o7 Not for making credits, cus you will need some prem shells here and there. Outside of that, yes its pretty good actually.
Just curious, but are there any WoW players that can boost my sorry ass trough the challenge mode dungeons before pre patch? :D #HALP
@JoshConover @PhlyDaily Ahah i am reading the comments, people are really dense holy shit ahahaha
@sn00ze81: Who will be the winner?? #fochball @SirCircon @SirFoch
@SirFoch: Hey guys today Me and @SirCircon will be casting the tank football finals at 1700 CEST on my channel, so no regular stream tod
@SofiGaming Exactly. I quite like the twitch culture, but like always, there are downsides. ^^
HEY WAIT A MINUTE. I HAD A FUN DAY STREAMING WOT TODAY. #justrealised #4hourslate Tier 9 is like a safe space :^)
It's 04;00 but i NEED to see the bethesda block in GamesDoneQuick, if my stream is late tomorrow, you'll know why! ^^
yo listen guys, listen, guys, listen. What if we play Blitz on Windows 10?
jesus christ, overwatch quickplay is full of people playing ''just for fun bro'' and there is no solo que for ranked. &lt;______________&lt;
playing some Black Desert Online, watching GamesDoneQuick and; Overwatch. Nice to unwind o/
@eeelliottttt There better be some sneaky CIRC ads in there :^)
@sn00ze81 Yeah, it was a good night, like i said, you tend to remember the painfull games more, unfortunatly, thanks for playing &lt;3
@DylanGambrel1 Anything that hasnt got a game mechanic as retarded as arty in it. ANYTHING AT ALL.
@WoTomatoSauce no arty cover at all, south spawn climb is way better, most meds in team win hill, win hill win game 90% of the time=Terrible
Who ever made the Malinovka map in WoT should be fired. #WorldofTanks
@GingesLife Dont think the above hard difficulty willbe in game soon tho
@MANvsGAME @Totalbiscuit @LAGTVNovaWar Rigged some CSGO cases, but hey, dont forget to buy cheap games mate :^)
@tommy_antonsen i have no idea, ill let twitch staff know
@sn00ze81 @SirFoch Mayby you can get an adult to help you.
Also im hosting GamesDoneQuick on my channel if you wanna watch something together with my chat :)
Thanks for tuning in, glad to see 1500 people watching tonight! See you tomorrow for some overwatch! ^^#CIRC
So, the mcCree nerfs where deff needed, but anyone that isnt godlike with the left click is almost dead weight. #Overwatch
''D.va can you go healer, we already got 2 other tanks.''''No sorry, i gotta practise D.va for comp.'' Kill. me.
YO @PhlyDaily LETS DO WOWP ON TUESDAY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Might actually watch iceland tonight, it would nuts if they win it
@Wargaming_netEN thats nothing compared to World of Tanks, there is arty there! Those buggers one shot you whole year 'round
World of Tanks was rough tonight, we'll try again on monday! Enjoy your weekend, i know i will #noWoTintheweekend &lt;3
@GingesLife temp. fix atm, the kit is getting rehauled on monday. ^^
Oi @Twitch love the addition of Social Eating category, just wondering if we can also get a social _drinking_ category. Thanks again, circon
Damnit, rank 54 placement, 1 is worst, 100 is best, i wonder how high you can get with just the 10 placement games.
Last placement match solo overwatch, lets gooooo so curious what initial rank is going to be
Also, real low amount of people that have mics in competitive mode so far! Hopefully better once placements are done :)
The hell, you get a point for winning placement, but nothing for losing at all? But its SOLO queu, who the fuck knows what kinda teams i get
electrician will be here tomorrow, between 0700 and 0800. Rip sleeping schedule, but atleast it will hopefully be sorted quick! ^^
Hopefully this electricity bullshit is solved quick, atleast i can stream with this ghetto set up. See you tomorrow! ^^ #CIRC
@GingesLife yeah same here, we got three, mine is the most right one, replaced and reset it, nothing changed
@GingesLife the one thung i can take out and replace, i did, the one switch i can use, i did. No idea what a reset trip is tho
Bought new like plugs for the electricity, still nothing, cant call till tomorrow the company i rent from, fuck my life
@Max_SRG i meant twitch cus i have no electricity
@UnholyMoses yeah but even new fuse doenst work atm
Alright, i have no electricity so i cant stream nor have a eta when im back up again. Its just my appartment, so i think im fucked.
Youtubers that follow me on twitter, how the fuck do i turn email notifications off for comments? #HALP
@unitlostgaming (   )
Hmmmmm feeling like i might go live for like a hour or 2. Hmmm
I dont mind traveling, but the wait to get on a train/plane does get a bit dull. ^^
@Cathril1986 I think its not to bad, like 30 minutes
@Cathril1986 Yeah, flight is delayed a little bit, just having lunch upstairs now.
@Mar_Wo Yeah, several. I had the intent of doing that this year, but just didnt came to be.
Getting questions about @ArmoredWar content, i'm basically waiting on patch 0.16 then ill probably stream it to check it out / youtube vid.
Thank you #CIRC fam for making tankfest even better! It was a pleasure meeting all of you! See you next year! ^^
Extremely nice meeting you people at tankfest today! Hope to see more people tomorrow! ^^ #CIRC #Tankfest
Alright then, who am i meeting tomorrow?1 #CIRC #tankfest
Ahah, 95% of content creators are at tankfest? Better release a new premium tank! #CIRC #Tankfest ^^
@TheWeuffel that one was all ellliot, all the highlight reels are, the one off vids are all mine :)
Now we wait to board the raiding vessel on rails #CIRC #TANKFEST
@Cathril1986 @ims89 see you at tankfest ^^ #CIRC
Also happy to report, that we are slowly, but very steadily getting news subs on my youtube channel! Hope to reach 62000 by end of tankfest!
@versitonic Goddamnit, i might have to accelerate my plans of getting a motorcycle license and a bike. Tour in 2020? :P
There are way to many people awake at these hours, waiting to board the plane, slept like 2 hours lel#CIRC #TANKFEST
@JesseCox: I was shocked at the lack of coverage about G2A and tinybuild, but then I remembered lots of people get pay checks from G2A.
@PhlyDaily Yeah, i would never attend that cesspool
@greg820918 Nice dude! Thanks for the support, hope you like it! ^^
@Murphy1up Why not just stay in england lol, you're flying back like thursday :P
@LiudasJ Fuck that, waiting on Game of Thrones son!
6 Videos +Highlights, all thumbnails, info, key words,feeling like a proper youtuber now.
I'm about 4 replay casts in, so nice to have the weekend off to sit down relax and do this :)
Ahah, sending my dad a personalised CIRC mug for fatherdays tomorrow. Hope it turns out well :D
Enjoy your weekend CIRC, ill see you all on monday! &lt;3
And thus began my first normal 'free' weekend in 4 years o/
@Murphy1up &lt;3 ^^ Best of luck man on your new adventures!
Oh my god. Playing some WoW PTR: Aka the rehaul of the classes. So far, they are amazing. Might have to make a guild for legion lol
@gewuerzkardinal Is that the grey one or just the light of the pic :P either way, thanks for the support! :D
Felt really good about this cast of tonight! See you tomorrow, O V E R W A T C H #CIRC &lt;3
@PhlyDaily mostly because the bitrate needed for 1080p on twitch isnt there yet
@Cm1994gaming nice! Hope you like it! Looks like the graphic translated well to the shirt.
@GingesLife @ArmoredWar Haha spotting in that, nice
@justinnieuw You can get it for like 1 Dollar if you wanted to.
@PhlyDaily @Battlefield Wait, you can play it already?!
Thanks for watching, see you tomorrow with O V E R W A T C H:D
PSA: I'm in a meeting with WG and the contributors for a couple of hours today. Delaying the stream till roughly 19:00CEST. See you soon! &lt;3
@Gjtjuh7 It is a good tank. But its overpriced and tier 7.
@PaleBlueDotBen Cant blame you, that ''great rehaul'' better be, eh,.. great.
I like the Vk 45.03, but by god is it frustrating to play tier 7 in world of tanks. : /
play 3 games in WoT to test new xvm, tier7,+0 +2 +2 MM and get artied in 2 of them instead of arty shooting the tier 9's :^)
@PhlyDaily I dont mind it, since they have a ton of youtubers/streamers there aswell and the ''trailers'' for them was great.
WW1/WW2 weaponry is so much more intresting then any other era, specially the near future bullshit.
Battlefield 1 looks dope. I'm sold. Also seems like battlefield bad company 2 level destruction on the buildings.
I couldnt give a fuck less about titan fall 2, since 1 was a let down. Bring on Battlefield 1 son
Just got home, i am exhausted. Good to see my family again, specially my nephews and brothers. ^^
Did not know destroyer 666 had a new album, pretty good so far, first 3 songs in.
Oh god, i got to get up super fucking early tomorrow, rip.
@ArmoredWar Any news on release date for that patch? :D
@SirSchmidt64 @Wargaming_netEN @worldoftanks Exactly.
Going to get a haircut in a hour, think ill just buzzcut it. o/
@Neonfieldmouse @Wargaming_netEN @worldoftanks Nah i just want to buy new prems with ingame gold. Happens far to little lately.
Curious to know if the VK 43 05 is going to be buyable of the tech tree at some point? @Wargaming_netEN @worldoftanks
I wish the people i've met with streaming would live closer, so i could have them over and play together on stream. o/
@sn00ze81 That is bert before he started shelling other people instead of having to duck and cover. :^)
@KriegsKuh i dont think those stats will happen, that list had tier 8 in it wilst they said they would do tier 10 first..
I need to do groceries, but its to damn hot outside and its now very nice and; cool in my room. #firstworldproblems
I slept like 5 hours, but i got my mobile AC unit boys o/
@Alley_gatorZZ yeah pretty nuts! More then some of the bands i listen to lol
Who ever did the buffs to the T110E5 should be fired. #rustled
@unitlostgaming Yea ill let you know how this one pans out o7
@unitlostgaming Yeah, same situation, right under the roof aswell. My room is like 4degrees+ more the the rest of the bloody place
@unitlostgaming depends how much m3 your doing, this one is roughly good for 80 m3. I only have like 21m3, i want to live in a mini fridge
@unitlostgaming Will do, yeah this one was kinda expensive, but if its good, its worth investing in. Otherwise my gear might melt. ^^
Keep watching/reading info on WoW:Legion and i cant resist the urge to be a little hyped. But if they pull another WoD i'm out for good lol
Thank you for watching! Again, not thousands of viewers, but i am honored to still have a couple hundred watch me play OW. &lt;3 See you monday
@billywarren007 @PHJ_Official @sn00ze81 @The_Aimless_ A license to be blamed
@PhlyDaily Yo why was this stream not announced on twitter. ;_;
@EthanWolfcat But its also a package, wich i am against.
@EthanWolfcat i'm not sure, since i dont play console version. But i heard well armored tanks do a bit better there, so it might be good.
Im going to run a little bit late today, pc screens are acting up/
Sometimes i feel that hanzo should have been the ''sniper'' class of OW. But then again, people would cry for sniper rifle class. Owell. ^^
@TimBiesiek Not at all, but some people are saying xvm is causing some of the crashes. But again, i personally had no issues yet!
@unitlostgaming The Junkrats (   )
And my last twitter spam today, i cant wait for tankfest, just to unwind a little bit :)
Oh and by the way, fallout 4 is one of my fave games and the latest DLC is certainly worth it!
@Lafeelabriel Jup! It was not to bad, atleast i had the chance to awnser some questions :)
Sorry for being a bit of a downer today, hope i awnsered a lot of your questions and tomorrow is overwatch time hype! :D &lt;3
That was one of the worst GoT episodes. But hopefully setting up for some epic ones. #GoT
@Leoninski Ahah no worries, i always think its cool when people dont think i am dutch. Hate the dutch-english accent.
@unitlostgaming Ahahah. I did not watch so _()_/
@unitlostgaming Thats a weird way of spelling #Overwatch
@tielknight i know! Been using it for a while :)
The cloud ls of weed smell in my city sometimes is crazy.
The games dont last that long, if your not commited dont queu up &lt;_&lt;
People that leave a overwatch game early, need a 30 min cooldown
@TheRagingTanker People talking in chat = EVERYONE EVER USES MODS. The logic.
@TheRagingTanker So you presume all my viewers use my modpack? you couldnt be more wrong, your jsut presuming a LOT
@TheRagingTanker @worldoftanks Also because of the modding scene that World of Tanks Vanilla finally added improvements to the minimap etc.
@TheRagingTanker @worldoftanks Because a lot of basic quality of life changes. Like a 4 row garage etc.
Apparently, today was 3854 Wn8 day, sure as hell didnt feel like it. Overwatch was epic once again tho! :D
I'm going to be roughly 30 minutes late today, got a video rendering right now tho, for you to watch wilst you wait! circSoon
playing some the division today and yesterday aswell, by god the pick up groups are terrible xD
Im so pale im pretty sure i can get sunburned walking to and from the grocerie store.
@eeelliottttt they should get like a minute downtime before able to queu or something aswell
People that leave mid game in overwatch should be punished way harder. #Overwatch
Gotta do some groceries, then make a couple of replay vids for youtube if i have any time left ill stream some overwatcherino :)
Holy shit, steam seems so frickin slow right now, i just wanna get warhammer memes
Absolutely love overwatch. Thanks for watching, i know not a lot watch, but who knows, that can always pick up in the future! :D &lt;3
The plaque of #Overwatch is snipers that THINK they are good and then the ones that ARE REALLY good :P
LOL just had a riptire that killed the ENTIRE enemy team, new players o/
i'm in (   )
Thanks for watching as always, dont forget to check my youtubes for more WoT. Playing @PlayOverwatch tomorrow and probably wednesday!
@Twitch@TwitchSupport Having issues again, stream showing up as online that are offline and the other way around. #halp
These little 1 replay a video vids, i could probably do a batch of them tbh.
Alright, i am actually going to sit down and try and make a youtube vid. Mayby like a replay cast? yolo
@rodneny Yeah, it always feels like ive been streaming for like a year, but then people resub for 30 months and im like, damn.
Just got home, will be a few minutes late, will be playing Fallout 4!
Whelp, bought some overwatch merch. I can quit whenever i want, honest.
@Peter_Pansky Cus i really want to play it but i cant stream right now ;)
I'm affraid ill have to play a bunch of fallout 4 offstream, xD
Seriously, how hard is it to have 1 damn campaign on @teespring that ships from both US and EU. I somehow have like 3 live campaigns now,ffs
@Trobsmonkey@totalwar ORC IZ BEST, LOOTIN' FIGHTIN' BASHIN STABIN
@mikelzinga Phone on wifi, phone twitch app = great succes
Submitted the Tshirt to teespring, awaiting approval!
@unitlostgaming @PaulChaloner Sweet, ill DM you my battlenet, paul already has it
@unitlostgaming See, i was followed, pretty sure i fatfingered and unfollowed on the phone :&lt;
@unitlostgaming i also seem to have fatfingered the twitter follow lmao
@BaronVonGamez 2/2 the grind needs to be fun and i like it if these games didnt punish you for not having the highest tiers/guns etc. :)
@BaronVonGamez Oh, most deff. I myself am struggeling to find things to do now, because i have all the tanks. Like i said,
@BaronVonGamez Thats what i like about overwatch, you have a lot to do and play and you can just unlock cosmetics o/
@BaronVonGamez Yeah, the magic is in making the grind enjoyable :)
@BaronVonGamez a lot of popular western games have this, destiny, battlefield, call of duty. Howmuch destiny would one play if he had it all
@BaronVonGamez i'm not saying press accounts are bad, you but lose a lot of game time there, no need to ''no life'' it :P
@BaronVonGamez Well i mean, you play for progression, to get the new plane in Warthunder, shiny jets/tanks right?
@BaronVonGamez To many press accounts, leaving you nothing to grind/obtain ;)
@ArmoredWar So tier is not decided yet then, curious how it will turn out!
@billywarren007 Welcome to the real world, where we pretend to know what we are doing. Grats on finishing uni! :)
@Murphy1up You can probably have them draw it from a shittier picture, which will happen anyway i think?
@LAGTVNovaWar Ahah, well i think its a good middle road, since i think a lot of people watch in theather mode etc.
@LAGTVNovaWar Ah okay, havent seen the multiplier in OBS, so i was wondering if you had a work around. Thanks for the quick reply.
@LAGTVNovaWar How are you able to set your output on stream to 1664 x 936 in (i think you use) OBS?
Every time i log in, im still like, damn this game looks so good. Specially around sunrise/sunset #BlackDesertOnline
Awwww shit, +30% exp in BDO till like monday. Hypuuu
i'm glad i don't have to hunt for my food. I don't even know where sandwiches live.
Reading more info on WoW:Legion, the fact that 5 mans are viable the entire way might pull me back in like no tomorrow, like diablo rifts.
@blueoval8950 the 85 line plays more like the rudy, but the obj.416 is the best tier 8 medium in WOT and; also leads to 2 tanks that are good.
@OxyOfficial #teamrowlet obviously the best new starter. Goodluck!
@OxyOfficial Oh shit! I thought you recently changed twitter handles, my bad! Also, suprised no Rowlet drawing yet!?
@OxyOfficial @LAGTVNovaWar You still have your old twitter handle on these drawings by the way! :)
''Nunextk : id f theres an easy way and a hard way. circon will take the memiest way'' Love my chat ^^
Thanks for watching everyone, was fun! RNGesus showed some mercy and wilst playing almost only tier 7, we still won 81% of our games xD
I hope people notice the sarcasm in both mine and the re tweet i did. Lmao
@Alley_gatorZZ about 2 hours, all the other ones i killed today where sub 30 minutes, dragonarmour guy was 2 shotted
@bartvh1986 The water one is lame, but the owl grass type is amazing xD
Whelp, TIL thatn when i am bored, i'm boring as balls on stream. Gotta fix that.
@denjamesm @thatbarnettblok this was at an event, why else would i take a photo and not a screenshot ;)
@GkzRebal Tried that like 2 years ago, i played the ps4 one today, controls are so awkward
@San4311 It was already fucked by the time this picture was taken lmao
Probably because i played a lot myself, but i find @PlayOverwatch a really good stream game, really fun to watch.
@The_Aimless_ Always fun to see my emotes show up in other channels o/
Overwatch actually got a lot worse with a bigger playerbase xD
I always feel super bad for doing this, like calling in sick to work. Not that i do this a lot. Owell! See you on monday or at battlecon. ^^
Feel like i need to take today off. Need to recharge my streaming batteries + i'm busy tomorrow meeting you guys at battlecon. :)
@foolonparade Hmmmmmmmmmmm. Man if this is legit then o/ but i feel something weird happend.
@foolonparade And exp? Was there anything for that aswell? it's so odd
Thanks for tuning in! see you tomorrow, same place, same time. :)
@PaulChaloner Yeah defiantly, all the plebs are here now.
@ProfMauriarty Yeah it is, suprisingly blitz is the version the WG ceo plays a lot. #tinfoilhat
@ProfMauriarty @WoTBlitz I get told this a lot, but is there actually someone thinking i play blitz?
just realised, why doenst @Wargaming_netEN #WorldofTanks just remove Fishermans Bay in 9.15 untill its fixed? #justathought
Watching GOT: 'God i hope you die, please dont die, this prick needs to die, please dont die, he is kinda cool please dont die, PLEASE DIE'
Thanks for tuning in as always fam, pretty long stream today, thanks for the support as always! &lt;3
no new items for diablo season is so sad, will probably still level to 70 for the cosmetics, dunno what class tho.
I hope up date 9.15 hits soon, because my rig gets way better fps in it whilst streaming.
Thats the main reason i never did ads, i dont want to dick over the people that show enormous support by subscribing.
@SirCircon 2/2 i could use the small break to walk around a bit and now it doenst bother the subs anymore.
@mikelzinga Thanks for the reminder, its already on! Funnily enough i might runs ads again because of this. Since it doenst bother subs
@SideStrafe Have fun man, playing that game for years 24/7 makes you look at the game differently. My bad.
@SideStrafe outside of the tier 8 Rhm. They are not really worth the time and effort. ^^
By god, i hope that the talks blizz will have with the Nostalrius guys will end up in them being hired and running legacy servers. #PLEASE
This is weird, if you have BDO open, any other game you play besides it, the mouse goes trough fullscreen to the other screens. O_o
How much is that, jagdpanther, panther1/2/8.8 panther m10 ?
I have this crazy idea of 3 marking all the panthers in WoT.
is EU2 still having issues in #WorldofTanks ? Or is it save to play there again?
@Murphy1up Solo = opportunistic vulture Platoon = Viking Raid of Death
Anyone else just had crazy lagg in #WorldofTanks ? Deff was the WoT servers, because my stream is fine. @Wargaming_netEN
Heyo @Twitch @TwitchSupport my channel is online, dashboard and twitch directory show it as offline. vica versa for other channels. #help
@MightyM0use1 check my spotify account, search for circon
@PhlyDaily @CROSSOUT_EN CLOSE but i need them KV-2 Mech legs boi.
Yo, @CROSSOUT_ENshould allow walkers at some point. #TheFuckingDream @PhlyDaily @BaronVonGamez
@BountyHunter84_ Only plebs arent there at 17:00CEST ! :P
Hosting food again because the chat made me do it. ;)If your bored, hang out!
Just FYI: Tomorrow Dark Souls - Wednesdays World of Tanks - Thursday probably happy hours even in AW. See you there! :)
You viewers where wonderfull tonight! Got 3rd mark in is-6, tier 9 patton and we are almost done in the type 59! (93.89) See you tomorrow!
As always, thanks for tuning in! Finally done the hydro 3rd mark :D
@PHJ_Official I'm an miracle worker. I did the impossible. :P
@David_Wellswell: @SirCircon still laughing at the north korea joke xD
@BountyHunter84_ Where the fuck are these pics even from lmao
Thanks for watching everyone, hope you had fun! The giveaways went really smoothly. Thanks for tuning in. :)
@MightyM0use1: .@SirCircon just posted a gif of action bronson, firmly cementing him as my favorite streamer of all time now.
Also nice meme, all the EU ingest servers are dead, so i am streaming trough the New york server lmao
@SirFoch What twitch ingest server you on? Mine keep dying
i wonder if the CIRC FAM has a tattoo artist in it.
Thanks again for watching CIRC FAM, was a bit rough around 2200 with the crashes, but we made it o/Finishing is-6 3 mark friday. &lt;3
Nevermind guys, they are thinking about fixing the servers. topkek
@Murphy1up @Wargaming_netEN Guess i should know better, because wargaming also has no clue whats its implementing :^)
@Murphy1up @Wargaming_netEN Well questions like that tend to get retweeted for people can awnser :D
@Murphy1up @Wargaming_netEN DO WHAT? YOU CANT DO ANYTHING. Lmao
World of Tanks servers crashing left and right, amazing #5yearsofWoTcrashing hype
@PaulBergerKwK it needs limited MM, better gun handeling, both the hydro and the turan. Turan also needs more then 32 shells
Pro tip, dont buy a turan 3, its utter shit. Like panzer hydro shit. Which is quite shitty.#WorldofTanks
@tjschmidt64 @Wargaming_netEN ofcourse not, that would make sense!
Yo @Wargaming_netEN What am i suppose to do, on cliff, with a turan 3 in a tier 7 dominated MM? Would love the communities input xoxo circon
@NOKINCHANCE @Twitch dont take it personal, but if you dont play for 30 days+ then there are more eager players waiting.
@NOKINCHANCE @Twitch 2/2 or mayby apply at circ2/3/4 since those are even more casual. A lot of people want to join CIRC so please
Whelp, just streamed for like almost 14 hours straight, dark souls 3 living up to the hype, hope you enjoyed it! See you tomorrow for WoT.
Thanks for watching tonight! Was epic! Thanks for all the support, a lot of new subs! Tomorrow DARK SOULS 3 MEMES! CANT WAIT! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@Wargaming_netEN @MightyJingles How could they lose, they had a CIRC Hoodie circHype
@PHJ_OfficialI am keeping an eye out for a certain hoodie today! ;)
Btw, hosting food memes again for those intrested
@SteelScooter That isnt even the meme cannon! :P Goodluck building it! :)
@jovanmhn1 all max, except object detail to medium
For a more casual game, tracer/genji are so hard to deal with. Some losses are purely because 6 of us cant stop the enemy tracer xD
Tonights stream after a rusty start was amazing! Thanks for tuning in CIRC FAM! See you friday! Enjoy your day off tomorrow ;)
Hey @ArmoredWar The panzerfest event, can i do split the battles need between pve and pvp?
@mikelzinga Yeah where do you think my sub sound is from xD
..must... not.... play... other... dark souls..... 6. more. days...... Halp
Live soon, i think AW then Overwatch later on! See you circSoon
@MWilson450 OH YES,right! I had that hosting issue, hopefully i can stream tomorrow! *cough*
okay fam, can we all agree today, never happend? Ifall your 1800 viewers could just be quiet about that be great! Ahah. See you tomorrow! &lt;3
@unitlostgaming You up for games tomorrow 17:00CET+ tomorrow? :D
@sn00ze81 the bulldog wn8 is not updated yet, but i had 1414 but shows as if i only played tier 10. So i dunno o/
I was so looking forward to it aswell today. Sigh.
I cannot believe, that in this many years of streaming, i'd have a day like this. It's been rough, see you tomorrow for some overwatch memes
@Murphy1up Thanks, would be a shame to not be able to get it, just because the mode itself was terrible.
Whelp, ONE HOUR later, it seems to work again. @TwitchSupport @Twitch @misterslin
@FerretBomb @SolidsSlaveShop @TwitchSupport Tried different servers, still nothing. Noticed @MANvsGAME had some weird issues aswell
Still cant stream due to RTMPSockBuf_Fill, remote host closed connection. @TwitchSupport @Twitch @misterslin
Hey @TwitchSupport I am unable to stream due to ''remote host closed connection'' error that OBS shows after i try to go live. Halp.
Silly thought of the night. Why doenst pokemon games have 1 single directory. You would increase the view count across the board. @Twitch
@rodneny I think it was one of the very first streams
CSGO stuff was suprisingly fun to watch, but probably more so because of the tweets about it when its happening ahah
@jmayer40 ill check later, make sure not the miss the game at 2h15min o/
@MeatheadMilitia go forth! Hope to have it for a montage with the IS8Balls
Hey @worldoftanks @Wargaming_netEN Can we have that april fools on the moon music sound track in full? :D :D
@Murphy1up Just bring the WG Office people one time and be done with it! :P
@jmayer40 Yo, thanks so much man, thats incredible! We where looking for you in the chat! :D
Thanks again for watching! Chat was lovely today, you guys and gals are great! &lt;3
@Murphy1up Goodluck man! I hate moving, but once you're set up its very nice o/
@darthregis I feel like all the UK tanks need like +5KM/H lol
And that still doenst solve the whole no UK tier 8 heavy thing :^)
OKAY, its a medium, i automaticly thought it was a heavy. Makes it less of an issue, since we have an amazing FV4202. Top kek
@SamuelAHallam looked at the past broadcast, good going :)
im hosting the twitch food channel, come hang out for bonus memes
@notch: The solution is to give the male characters the ability to make the same pose, Blizzard, not to cowardly let the outrage bullies
Thanks for watching fam! You guys and gals where wonderfull tonight! &lt;3 See you tomorrow for, probably overwatch?! We'll see! Peace out! &lt;3
New emotes are going to be sickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
those who are loyal, will see a special treat right now. :^)
I realllllly want to play Dark Souls 3. I think it's going to be a blast on stream :D
Also special shout out to Lorven1 - HolyMoscue - SpiderParker Thank you so much! &lt;3
Hope you guys enjoyed this adventure into the lower tiers, see you monday! &lt;3
Thanks for watching today, you guys are awesome :) See you tomorrow, moar WoT.
Fuck its 07:00 almost already? I am not done with this playlist yet damnit! xD
@Slohero Yeah magic online seems deeper with more modes, but i like the shiny graphics with the noobs over on origins :P
So Magic Online was like hella confusing, Magic Origins is a lot better for a noob like me, it's pretty neat.
@tielknight Would be so sick + ingame from the start not a patch later &gt;&lt;
Wow, very cool, those wolfi tanks you can buy with your ingame gold from the website :D
Late night overwatch really brings out the toxic trolls lmao
Also, can i just say, i love roaming around in Fallout 4.
Ashens has like the dream yt channel. Fun, original, easy to do, only once a week upload. Been watching him for a while now :D
@Death_Thumbs No need to act elitist mate. At least you know you where overreacting with the initial tweet :^)
@Death_Thumbs I didnt even insult you, i honest dont know if your trolling or actually retarded. I geuss you choose the latter. :^)
@Death_Thumbs You where clearly pissed that i didnt reply to your single tweet that i didnt notice at the time. Please, dont backpeddle now
@Death_Thumbs ''no need to get all pissed off'' - Said the one, that got pissed off. Well played :^)
@dan_vla Again i understand why, but felt like tweeting my thoughts about it :)
@Death_Thumbs Miss one question, instantly hitler apprently :^)
@Death_Thumbs LOL i scrolled down, apparently you asked me about stickers someone else made. How can you get this mad about this?
Kinda feels like the rich get richer. You'know? My 2 cents.
2/2 between them and the 1k&lt; view count streams. Which makes me a bit sad.
I completely understand why it happens. But giving ''the big streamers'' early releases like now with DS3, just increases the divide 1/2
Lmao, today was some of the worst teammates i've seen in a while! Still got a couple of good games in tho! We'll try again friday! &lt;3
Mines is the biggest bullshit map in World of Tanks, for years now. #justsayin :(
Thanks for playing today Conway and; @PaulChaloner Team where rough but enjoyable :D
ive never played magic, but i feel the urge to play it. What the fuck.
How the fuck was today still worth 3500 wn8 i literally played like a clown on meth xD
Thanks for watching again! You guys where awesome! :D
contemplating bringing back WoT to saturdays. It might be time to regain our forces before we go on another variety twitch channel crusade.
Alrighty people, ill stream today, but i am starting at 18:00. Just need to sort some stuff out, feeling a bit better today :)
Seriously feels good to have a day like this again. I really needed it.
The best stream of 2016 today! Thanks for tuning in Fam! See you friday! &lt;3 Thanks for joining ladies: @SirFoch @AgingJedi @sn00ze81
@TheBeardGuys @BaronVonGamez Once i am done with Europe, i will claim back Amsterdam in the US &gt;:D
@LAGTVNovaWar WTF, Damn man, goodluck with that mess.
@AgingJedi FYI i am playing WoT till 21:00CET Today! So i hope you can come on a bit earlier :D
lol just solo'd a the division hard mission (daily) and the last boss drops a yellow :D
@CptJackZ Yes, you choose the UX2 as if it was your microphone, its really easy to use.
@CptJackZ mic -&gt; (phantom power) UX2 - UX2 USB to - USB soundcard back of pc :)
@BountyHunter84_ I might do a long overwatch stream when that game launches! Outside of that i still want to do a charity one.
@r104d There is already a version on my twitch page, but it has some bugs, i think because of XVM.
@SirFoch Guardians of the Galaxy| New Vikings episodes | Latest season house of cards | Season 1 of GOTHAM | The underworld movies |
When are we getting rid of the damn mines map, seriously. #WorldofTanks
@Golem501 @DezGamez @SirFoch @RitaGamer @WorldofWarships I uninstalled warships because of the insane shot rng.
@FridlyBandit @RitaGamer @MightyJingles According to most people +2/-2 is just fine :) I am not one of them :D
20 ms - 0,80MB down - 5MB up Great internet right now ;_;
@sn00ze81 You only tried that because you saw the cool kids doing it :^)
Overwatch, The Division, Black Desert Online. And to think i was getting bored a month ago :D
@leviathan6341 Im really bad at youtube tho, But responding to the few questions i get on YT i usually do awnser those.
Practicly level 50 in BDO, just need to do a couple of quest, otherwise you cant ding 50. :D Fishing boat about 50% done
@TheThyregod I pretty much finished WoT months ago. Nothing new to get in that game for quite some time. Jap Heavies dont count
@TheThyregod Black Desert for now, but ineed to see end game division first
it's been a while since an mmo captivated me this much. Still craving moar Black Desert Online
Played for roughly 9 hours of the division got almost to level 22, 30 is max. So far pretty good and fun combat. Will stream it again sat.
Fuck i really need some sleep, so takinganap back in a couple hours!
Think ill just fix my self a dinner at 10:15, then shower then strums
@truxrobj97 As long as it arrives at some point, ill be fine.
Alright, did some testing, i think i have a solid 60fps 720p stream ready to go for the division, just need to get some supplies! :)
@spostma95 I am pretty sure 80% of my viewers just like to watch and not play ahah
By the way, WoT feels way better to play for like 3-4 hours like we did today.
Crazy stream tonight, like i said, cutting it 2 hour short, so ic an prepare for division memes for tomorrow! Aiming for a 12:00CET start.
What ill probably do is streama bit shorter monday, so i can stream earlier on tuesday for the division. :)
@ActiveGabelous The simple fact you can buy ''insurance'' for your CD key for extra money. But money talks, so A LOT of streamers have it.
@ActiveGabelous Jup. I've been saying that as long as i've been streaming.
All these fucking pancake streamers joining GFG. Almost as disgusting as streamers partnered with G2A. Sigh.
@FazakerleyP Honestly havent played it in so long. The +2/-2 MM grinds my gears to much lately. (So i play a lot of tier 9-10 only)
Then again i am not expecting a smooth launch at all. XD
Mayby i should ditch mondays stream and stream the division at 06:00 tuesday morning for the whole day. ^^
@unitlostgaming btw we should do some overwatch together sometime. :)
@unitlostgaming Not at all, most PVP related things arent activated yet. It's all about exploring, crafting etc. ^^
Black Desert is better then i ever would have expected. Extremely enjoyable crafting system among other things, ty for watching tonight! &lt;3
@SirFoch Yeah its buggy, took a couple of days for it to go to normal.
@MisterGuitarino Still havent been there. Should go sometime
I just want to get some supplies and lock myself up in black desert online for like a week xD
@mikelzinga Yo facebook is fine, havent logged in today yet tho
@TheWackyDave Oh yeah way ahead of you, its not on spotify :(
Thanks for tuning in, was a really good stream today. Feels good! See you friday &lt;3
@Murphy1up @MisterConway You boys up for some overwatch memes?
I think ill stick to regular schedule this week and switch next week(monday) Tonight mayby some AW? :)
@Misterjunkz Ahah, that still could be fun on a private server with the gang i reckon.
@Careoran ACtually installed that to make room for Black Desert Online
@billywarren007 Fake ID dates dont count billy #nicetry
@MrMcderp Wait, i couldnt tell if this was just banter or not, like i said on stream. Wtf happend?
@PHJ_Official There is probably a timezone where im not late?! :P
I might actually fire up the SMASH Offspring album and pokemon yellow again ahahah #childhood
@The_Aimless_ i might actually get up early on sunday then xD
Ahah, thats actually pretty dope that they brought back pokemon red/blue and yellow to work on the 3DS #childhood
Getting pretty hyped for Black Desert Online, anyone know what time CET the headstart, starts?
Guys im probably not streaming tonight, just need to relax a bit :)
@anotheribex I dont mind them, but the graphic is a bit to big and like right in your face.
@relonor Not at all yet, i played CBT1 and then just decided i want to start the game as noob/fresh as i can :)
Almost time for the release of The Division and Black Desert Online :)
@PhlyDaily Best part is, he could take that same volley of shots about 50 times and have 50 different outcomes. YAY
Finished XCOM2! Can highly recommend playing it if you havent already! :)
@PlayOverwatch: @Nyrang_ Yes! We will be adding more heroes and maps after launch. No timing for specifics other than they will all be f
I think a mod just went rogue and timedout or banned like 11 acc in a row, so just PM one of the remaining moderators to unban next stream
Thanks for watching! Cant wait for xcom 2 tomorrow, see you then! &lt;3
@Cruxyst3 Looks like another night for me to avoid tier8-10 lol
@timthetatman Hey man, i got the same mic/mixamp (podfarm-UX2) What is your podfarm 2.5 set up? Couple of screenshots wouldnt hurt! :D
Thanks for watching everyone, streaming xcom is really fun! And we had 500 viewers at all times wilst doing so :) Thanks everyone!
Package came in, now i need to order a XLR cable, wich i thought i had lmao, it looks great tho :D
This week is a bit wonky streaming hours, starting next week, everything should be 'normal' again :)
Heads up!Tomorrow schedule: 17:00-19:00CET=WoT | 19:00-22:00CET=AW | 22:00-00:00CET=WoT ||||||| Saturday: XCOM2 + (AW19:00-22:00CET)
Just watched Deadpool, Pool Boy, it was great, really entertaining :)
@ArmoredWar i know we got a week of +50% basicly for free, but are you selling those seperately soon again? the boosters? :D
@DodgeD150 I only have the T-90MS out of those 2 and doing1k+ hits with heat never got old.
@rodneny o/ 2 more days of boosts to go aswell :&gt; 100.000.000 credits dream
Hello @Razer Why are the Razer-Electras not for sale anymore? There is nothing quite like them in the rest of your headphone range.
@BountyHunter84_ i never do anything with the pc side of the settings, just ingame
@BountyHunter84_ The biggest FPS killer is object detail, turn that to medium atleast.
Im so torn, playing WoT for sure, but the AW from 19:00 till 22:00CET is so good XD
Todays Stream schedule: 17:00-19:00CET XCOM2 | 19:00-22:00CET AW | 22:00-00:00CET XCOM 2
@mlm430047 how would that burst my ego ahah, cool stuff
@wontcatchme Weird i never touched my spotify settings
The fuck dude, i got 1500+ followers on spotify now. That is so awesome
Soooooooooooooooooooooo. Where are the event boosts? even my 100% Rep one is gone. @ArmoredWar
@GingesLife if thats tidy i live in the cleanest place on earth
@PHJ_Official 18:00CET the even is from 18:00 to 21:00CET ill be doing about 8-9 PVE missions then on to pvp i think.
@TheWeuffel in what parallel universe are you living lmao
watched ''Making a Murderer'' doc, they are both innocent as all hell and the police framed the shit out of them. Sad panda
Tomorrow stream = Armored Warfare and XCOM2, see you then! &lt;3
Also, thank you guys for going past 8000 twitter followers &lt;3
Dont let anyone fool you with ''relaxing with some overwatch'' that game is competitive as all hell. Still a lot of fun tho! :D
@BethesdaStudios: We know you ready to learn what coming for Fallout 4 DLC. We not far off, and we think you be excited.
@MisterConway @SirFoch @PHJ_Official @sn00ze81 already playing all day lol
@AgingJedi @Wargaming_netEN 4) Die to a shot by arty ;)
@sn00ze81Yeah we need a full team! we need 6 people total then the overwatch memes start :D We could even custom match against friends
@sn00ze813 matches later its okay again o/ fuck you sn00ze &lt;3
the @PlayOverwatchservers are more potato then this weeks twitch servers lmao
Thanks for watching all! Back Friday, ill probably stick to playing tier 9-10 fora while, tier 8 and below is unplayable in World of Tanks
@Lafeelabriel Oh boi, twitch has been really good lately. -_-
one more follow on twitter and ill have exactly 8000 :^)
@GMWimbley Dont really care but my friends are i think mostly for panthers
@GreenEye_nl i mostly watch for the commercials, believe it or not, geuss thats my old studies kicking in.
Yo where are people watching the superbowl online at? The CBS sports livestream doenst load for shit :&lt;
@TristanArtmann: @SirCircon Was alot of fun watching!
xcom 2 is a lot of fun, will continue the run on tuesday &lt;3 Should you have missed todays stream, you can watch it back, not muted!
Like does @WorldofWarships actually get good at tier 9-10 like World of Tanks or what? tier 8 and below battleships is just RNG-City.
i really want to like @WorldofWarships and get a yamato, but i cant help but feel that the battleship acc. is just FUCKING HORRIBLE AT BEST
@Murphy1up Cool man! one day ill visit Scotland for a holiday :D
Good times today, thanks for watching, see you friday! :)
@Murphy1up Going to Scotland again so soon? Nice :D
@ArmoredWar Why did you guys already nerf day 5 of the daily rewards system so quickly :(
I wanted to be able to upload the video today (wednesday) but it will probably be thursday. It's FV 4202 P Review :)
Spend the last two hours in Premiere Pro, i think i need another 1230919412 hours.This is going to be a long journey to learn everything :)
Like i said on stream yesterday, taking today off, will be back tomorrow with WoT. ^^
@PHJ_Official Just go out hunting and forage some berries, spend the money saved on some premium time packages for world of warplanes
@TomHancock2916 True that, i am pretty straightforward about these things, but it's bad for my ''image'' at times, i geuss.
I shouldnt even tweet these things! Nevermind ^^
@rucereal2k Oh no, they get spotted by said aggresive heavies and meds! :D
Funny how arty never seems to punish the actual camping TDs but always the aggresive meds and heavies :^) #wearethinkingaboutit
Btw, youtubers and mayby some streamers getting to stream XCOM 2 like 5 days early, is incredibly fucked up for the smaller streamers.
Almost ready for strum. Going to try couple of tweaks to OBS settings today. :)
By god, could we just reverse a WoT patch and just never ever add the japanese heavy tanks, specially the O-I can just go take a hike.
Had to wake up early early early today, so might stream earlier :)
The Division was dope! Deff checking out the full release in march! XCOM 2 Next Saturday btw :D
@dud3lix shot a lot of tier 8 - 9 not enough tier 10s :)
@AstaLawl probably not, since i havent left my bed yet no/
Got to say, looks pretty damn dope and i love 3rd person shooters like this! Cant wait to play tomorrow on streamerino :)
Alright, tested the division, ultra 60fps, runs smooth, but ofc didnt stream, just loaded in, didnt really play yet, waiting till sat. :)
Yo @MightyJingles it's been a while, but check your email for a replay :3
@MANvsGAME never understood how streamers can push that shitty site
Giving @WorldofWarships another chance, if i get bored we switch to AW. Live soon.
@blkhks I mean, lower tier torpedos are still fun
So what are we playing tonight? Ships? AW? Dankest Dungeon?
@iambillvincent2 gimme yer twitch name ill unban
@Twitch is having a lot of issues, i'm still here and streaming, but you guys arent receiving it for the most part. All we can do is wait.
@TwitchSupport: We're looking into site loading issues, hold tight! ^DM
Funky to see 600+ People for Darkest Dungeon, was suprisingly fun! Thanks for watching, have a great sunday! &lt;3
@sn00ze81 It cant be much worse then RNG in WoT right? :^)
@allisinthepass1 Looked into it, didnt really strike me as a game i would enjoy. But ill probably try it someday!
@PhlyDaily Didnt we talk about that like couple days ago, lmao
@Cyberwraithx1 @eeelliottttt thats pretty much circSoon tho :P
Lurking around in AW streams, see my own emotes pop up, feelsgoodman
@TheNechrom to each his own i geuss, didnt play in a long time and nothing really changed, geuss ill wait a bit longer ;)
@joecairns yeah the shot inconsistency is just to much in my opinion.
instal @WorldofWarships again, play a battleship, miss cruiser 1201 times with 5KM, miss 80-90%. Annnnnd uninstalled.
@San4311 Yeah the 24/7 loading is annoying as heck
@TheThyregod Tomorrow? Mayby i have NO clue what to do for tomorrows stream :)
Overall pretty good stream today, to bad arty ruined my mood enough to not stream a bit longer then usual today. Owell #therethinkingaboutit
@GTThrawn wow, these videos got boring really quickly
@SarrusMacMannus most of the maps listed, are also pretty bad. Suprised to not see mines or sand river tho.
For the first time in a long time, i feel bored. I might actually start being productive soon. lmao
@Cyberwraithx1 You just linked the entire stream :P Btw, thanks for subbing so long mate! :D
@PhlyDaily You should really tweet when you go live lol
@Murphy1up People in chat had the same, everytime it was because they had adblock on.
i've decided that i will not be 69 years old, ill just go from 68 to 70.
@ahmadjavedaj Cool, ill be doing DH, streaming D3 on saturday! : )
@ahmadjavedaj Yeah thats why i am rolling DH or Crusader, because i already got a good WD/BARB/MONK in non seasonal set up.
i cannot decideee the classsssssssssssssssssssss, leaning towards crusader, but ONE DH set looks awesome. :&lt;
Hey CIRCFAM, for those intrested, D3 is actually updating for me now in EU. Ill be playing crusader on saturday.
Alright listen guys, i been streaming a lot extra hours lately, so i am going to cash those inand start a little bit later today, 18:30ish
@Wargaming_netEN EU1 is RIP and it is holding my T54 hostage :(
D3 Season next week, what class do i go for....................... DH or Crusader as i played monk/barb a lot during previous seasons.
Got another 3rd mark! E75 this time, next 3rd mark is i think T-10, but we'll see! Thanks for tuning in fam! &lt;3
Sidenote, the amount of new subs today was real! Thanks you guys for the support! its been nuts lately! &lt;3
@BroermanWilliam That was probably just the chat bot, whats your twitchname ?
@vidirh Yes, you're clearly the calm, friendly guy here :^)
@vidirh: @SirCircon Good luck living of your streams you cunt. Cant take people disagreeing with you. You'll end up with yes people arou
@vidirh: @SirCircon How pathetic can you be Somebody digresses with you in chat and you ban them. No fucking wonder you have a hard time
Anyone know a site to make a easy petition that you can sign with like your twitter account? Want to make one to ban Sand River / Mines
Oh man that feel when your off day is mostly spend in public transportation #dafeels
@Chunkyfunk01 its really cool, BUT ONLY WITH A FULL GROUP OF FRIENDS.
Also, thanks for watching Dark Souls 2 with 600+ viewers most of the time! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
I think the updated BIOS and volt changes actually fixed my PC. No freezes the last 16 hours its been on. Hopefully its cleared now :)
For some reason AC: Syn eats my CPU alive, like vermintide before the fix. :&lt;
So, how about some assassin's creed syndicate tonight? Or do you guys have better suggestions : )
it was great to return to 2000+ viewers on twitch today. Thanks for tuning in &lt;3 Working this month on getting better audio!
Happy New Years everyone! Hope you enjoyed the little streamerino! &lt;3 See you tomorrow! :D
Also shout out to my australian fam for the insane support lately. Happy new year, errr, mate? ;)
Faq it, i will stream today, into new years, but i'm taking things easy, since its my off day, so ill start at like 22:00CET ;)
I should be a commander in @ArmoredWar with among other things, the skill that increases credit gain :&gt; #WORTH
@tomparker135 hell yeah, try it out mang, its F2P anyways
Mannn.. after the OP xmas special, the dailies in AW feel sad now xD
@Murphy1up Luckily there are no ghost shells in World of Tanks.
Very relaxing to start the day with some @ArmoredWar PVE
@Peter_Pansky where? Cus that gamespot link sure doenst count as social media :)
Why the fuck is Valve/Steam not fucking saying anything on social media about what happened yesterday. #SHAME
@tomparker135 I always recommend the FCM 50T and; CDC, but they require some finesse to play.
Dont know what is happening with the stream today and wednesday... but damn. Love you guys! :D
@Totalbiscuit: Do NOT attempt to login to Steam atm. Just, don't touch anything, that's the safest thing you can do.
@AgingJedi: EU bonus code for 24 x chocolate #worldoftanks: AXTHGH12BN15MASA :D If I find any codes for NA and SEA I'll post too. Merry 
Thanks for watching today! Was good fun and the first ever donation train was mental at the end of the stream! &lt;3 See you friday!
@Kramyarg72 Obj. 140 for days, its just simply better. Also, no idea. rumours on reddit is a tier 8 us prem!
@Quickybaby Streamtip is down, you wont get the donations/texts you might want to inform your viewers. I let you know in your chat aswell.
@DenkaSaeba25 @ArmoredWar wish i could show the replay hnnnnggg
@NightDev it worked again about 3 hours into the cast. ty
@NightDev I think your servers are down, on screen chat, donation, sub alerts, all dont work! :)
@unitlostgaming Like i tweeted, hope it doenst go the archeage way. Luckily trion isnt involved with this.
@unitlostgaming So far so good. Havent gotten really far yet. But the game runs solid, looks great and combat is silky smooth.
Oh god, trying out black desert EU servers. Please dont fuck up the monetization of this game. It looks amazing #pleasenoarcheage2
Hey there @MoriVisuals can you follow me on twitter, so we can DM? Just stumbled on your work and i would love to talk to you.
I am a World of Tanks Secret Santa, super curious what the gifts are outside of the special medal. o/
btw without spoiling, i'd rate the new movie a solid 8 out of 10. Time flew by and was very entertaining. Glad i watched it early! :D
I now wield the power of star wars spoilers.. closest ill get to the force. Muhahah ^^
Fun day of Kerbal today! Thanks for watching! &lt;3
I always have this idea in the back of my head to run a casual raid night on WoW. Mayby with legion o/
You know! I think i recovered well streaming wise, after that first ''arty'' hour :D
@Murphy1up Mines should be tier 5 max, been saying it for years! :D
@Legenot (   ) you're even reading that in my voice now arent you
@AgingJedi What the actualllllll fuck. Bit unfair aint it. :/
play testing my years old mech warrior online account, might stream that on saturday? :D
I dont know what changed but streamtip and nightdev tip notifier actually work now. Should be way easier for people to add a message :D
@The_Novabreaker Duuuuude thats sick! Thats good to hear and thanks for the support! :D
@CaptainT0m Upload it to imgur and send me the link in a facebook pm or twitch pm! :)
Also new content patch for Path of exile in 2 days..... might have to retry that game... :)
Question! Anyone able to make my logo, into a slowly spinning 3D coin in gif form? :D
Dunno why, but i am feeling pretty happy lately. Mayby its the cat :O
@sn00ze81 @SirFoch Oi, have fun on your trip mate! :D
I dont get twitch subs sometimes, how in the fuck can you be up a bunch of subs, then wake up to -15 the next day. xD Owell
Hey! My pc didnt freeze all day? I THINK WE FIXED IT. circDeal circClap
@allisinthepass1 Ahah ill save it for a rainy day, been feeling better and better for the last 2-3 weeks. &lt;3
Deff want to try out Devilian tomorrow, servers should open at 19:00CET tho. So ill play something else before it. See you guys then, GN
The T-22 Tank + Personal missions should just be revoked and; redone for a future patch. Sigh.
just had some OP huge arse patch to Window 10, not the regular updates and i think it might have done the trick... we'll see tomorrow!
@TNT_Anima Hey thanks man, always nice to hear some support &lt;3
anyhow, gained 400 yt subs last month, we are about 200 away from 55000 total. :) Also, goodnight cus its 05:15 over here, rip
..a awesome 4 hours, then get bored the last 2-3 hours you know.
I also think that 5th-6th hour is where most streams kinda lose their steam. So does mine for the most part. Rather do a..
@tarv0028 I worked night/graveyard shifts at cinema aswell, thats where this schedule kinda came from. Hopefully you'll find a way out :)
@blkhks in total, for a week, i'd actually stream 1 hour WoT less a week. 3x7H vs 5x4H
Cus right now, even if i ate healthy, i eat at such shiat times. The time between streams could mayby make me more productive..
and still keep atleast 1 but probably same 2 days off.
Worried this might not be optimal to retain subs/viewers tho. But i could for instance stream WoT every night. off game in the morning.
I am thinking of doing: 10:00CET-13:00CET and 20:00CET - 24:00CET or 19:00 - 23:00CET. So i can mayby get a bit more healthy.
laten night thoughts, i feel like i want to have a bit more normal time schedule, So i can eat like a normal person and leave the house lol
Btw the latest marvel series on netflix jessica jones is pretty damn cool. Awesome villian
Anyone know why we cant buy the exp boosters for World of Tanks? @worldoftanks @Wargaming_netEN
@SirFoch I just caught that end set only, heard it was all awefull
W T F was that ending DJ set @ Game Awards?! LOL
The WoW Legion Alpha looks so good. Just hope it will have actual content patches. I might actually stream some of that at release. :)
@puni_2k ahahah that makes it even better! Thanks for letting me know! &lt;3
@PawlikowskiDave: @SirCircon Best stream in a long time yesterday. WOT seemed fun again! Listened all day in the van. Bring back @AgingJ
@GTThrawn deff looks good with the eyepatchnthe headphone middle part might needs to be up a bit more, towards the middle of top of head./
@AgingJedi Roger i added him on twitter, if he did the same we can PM/DM on twitter for ease.
yo @DezGamez ill add you on twitter, so we can DM!
@AgingJedi Ofcourse, you know my streaming hours
@AgingJedi Good stuff mate! Hope to see you again next wednesday mayby? :D
Stream will be delayed a bit, still on the phone with the people that are shipping my mic stand etc. I'm still on hold :&lt;
@BaconSensei  LIGHT MK.VIC; T7 COMBAT CAR; PZ.KPFW. II AUSF. D; LTP; TETRARCH;5 GARAGE SLOTS;GOLD: 150
Xmas specials today for WoT: EU one is 'alright' looks a bit pricey, but the tetrach has been in way, WAY worse bundles.
@joewolf232Personally not going to bother with the missions untill they are doable as a solo player.
@joewolf232 So wilst i understand why, the rigging needs to be stopped. Mayby remove the T22 from rigged accounts together with a time ban.
@joewolf232 The Missions are bad, Everyone is rigging them, Tank probably to good. Forcing Clans to rig them to stay competitive in CW.
@jkleiner17 Holy shit nice dude! GL in AW also! :D
@Tbbalfour Nah ill ace it and call it a day, wich seems to happen to a lot of prems lately.
@NijmanRick PZb2 has tier 4- MM always, it does not see tier 5+
To slow for landslide wins, To Slow to go to another flank, Aiming is horrid, No Armor, 6 sec reload for 160 dmg, good pen, but tier 4.
So there is a new tier 4 prem for sale for just today. is it any good you ask?nITS TIER 4nNO.
Tonights stream: Mayby check out the new tier 4 prem WoT / Just Cause 3 / Mayby Battlefront at the end to check out new map! See you soon!
@The_Aimless_ @billywarren007 @PHJ_Official is everyone able to play that this saturday? :D
@AgingJedi yo Oake, if you wanna play some World of Tanks, come by the stream wednesday, we'll hook you up with out TS etc.
@foolonparade I know, but i grinded like 3 million+ exp already xD
NICE Found a mixer, mic arm and new mic at a really good discount, will be here on tuesday after 17:00CET! Hype :) (no more rip ears?!)
@billywarren007 @PhlyDaily Where not talking about your life right now Billy.
You know, i could do a 36H stream the friday of the week the new CZ line is introduced and play starting at tier 1 - free exp for modules
WTF is going on, not a single entertaining stream to watch wilst i grind damnit
@allisinthepass1 Sweeeeeet thanks for the support! &lt;3

I think ill play AW untill i am able to get on the WoT test server today.
@Tasty_Shrimp @sn00ze81 Jup! Crazy good time to play @ArmoredWar atm!

People that play stormtroopers without helmets in battlefront should be ashamed of themselves! :P
The rental tanks should have been the 113, FV4005 and the Foch 155. @Wargaming_netEN
@Wargaming_netEN Do we need any secondaries for the T22SR missions? :D
@darthregis @Wargaming_netEN @worldoftanks Jup it is!
I really dont understand why EU gets star wars battlefront release 2 days later, what is this, the 90's? Owell, probably play some FO4 then!
Hearing about the stuff in paris hope @Wargaming_netEN and everyone else is alright! &lt;3 France &lt;3
@tanksgg Jup, probably one if not the first :D I do tend to link them to the site aswell, so thanks for making such an awesome site!
@tanksgg Yo thanks for adding me on the frontpage ''featured streams''! I didnt even knew! Thanks mate.
Starting at 18:00CET (1h later) Today, had to take care of a lot of stuff! (still no barber tho D: )

@PhlyDaily say i downloaded WT.. say that i might get that rocket buggy of russia. Would you wanna record a vid together? :D #foralaugh

@Lafeelabriel Looks nice so far, wanted to see more races then humans and orcs tho ;P
not feeling well, but watching blizzcon is pretty good so far. Insta buying the overwatch origin edition.
Sorry for ending the stream early, as i tweeted earlier, i am really not feeling all to well and its getting worse sitting behind the pc.
Well just had to trow up a lot, probably ate something bad yesterday. Heading back to bed, well see if i can stream tonight.
@Wargaming_netEN @Quickybaby World of Tanks? SHOCKING decision. ;)
@ArmoredWar @PHJ_Official Works now! odd, but thanks! :)
Anyone else stuck on Authenticating in @ArmoredWar today or just my client?
@darthregis I can barely run a livestream, let alone an IT job! :)
Arty was still not fixed in WoT in 2162 btw #timetravel ;)
The hell, well it finally allowed me to manually set my time now lol. Okay then...
My windows 10 thinks its tje year 2163 and a lot of programs now dont work because of that yay..
Windows 10 crashed, ill be back on friday with another stream! Thank for watching overwatch everyone :)google chrome even ripped fully lol
Hey @Murphy1up if you wanna play some @PlayOverwatch tonight, hop on our TS! I think conway will join us aswell.
...INSTALLING OVERWATCH, PLAYING THAT SHIT ALL NIGHT ON STREAM TOMORROW! :D
@Quickyfartyy tho, also no gun depression, no armor with a big silhouette
@VersiGaming in dire situations you can always crash at my place mang.
Anyhow, i just got home from helping my fam out, going for a shower and a meal then ill streamerino! :D
it's funny how little English streamers there are for WoT these days. 1 year ago there was always a bunch.
@PHJ_Official dont fuck up bromania this time ;)
By the way, helping my brother move in to his new appartment today. No clue if i can stream and if i can, at what times. :)
Rumors of war - High on Fire, listen now if you're into heavier rock. ^^
@VersiGaming versi, goodluck with those elections, hope you win. ;)
75% to the t90 now, i grinded soooo much exp this weekend holy...
So its top donation - flag/logo - webcam - circonflexes - weeks donations from top to bottom.
The Emblem thing was pretty bad in WoT, but how is there not this level of riot for an arty revamp? +2MM? Bit worse then tank stickers.
Watching some top streamers play overwatch, honestly looks like a lot of fun and a LOT more competitive then i thought! Cant wait! :D
There is like 100+ twitch Overwatch streams with 0-1 viewers xD
@Murphy1up @YouTube Wish i was in the beta :&lt;
going to be like 10 min late today, groceries took forever because there was only one cash register open -_-
Day 2, still not in the @PlayOverwatch beta. Sadface
@Ha3d0r sure, why not. Again shitty bundle, but atleast i can show it to the stream.
@Murphy1up @OverwatchEU you and your damn connections! ;)
RNGesus, please help me at my dankest hour. Please give me a @PlayOverwatchbeta key, so that i may spread the worth in thy name on twitch.
@Mar_Wo: @Wargaming_netEN Your refusal to fix arty?
Starting stream at 18:00 Today, kinda forgot about dinner. LOL
@ArmoredWarSeems to work again! Probably a small hickup?^^
@Mar_Wo @ArmoredWar Yeah, that is the forums, but i fail to see the post about the server.
So... @ArmoredWar servers are down? ''Visit the forums for more details.'' Anyone got a link? :)
So... who can get me in tje Overwatch beta? Would love to stream that with the crew
I'm pretty sure something is f*cked with the EU twitch servers, can anyone confirm? @Twitch @TwitchSupport ...
@teespring Because the Tshirts where mostly sold to EU last time, but there was no teespring in EU yet.
@teespring Because of this, i will send them an email and hope that it's fixed soon and launch the campaign asap.
Hey everyone. @teespring Seems to be bugged, i cannot launch a campaign set to EU Fulfillment. Wich means EU people will pay a lot more.
@teespring Trying to make an hoodie campaign, as a twitch partner but the site Freezesif you select EU Fullfilment option. :(
@teespring Can someone help me out, my campaign keeps dying once i switch it to EU as fullfilment option. HIGHLY ANNOYING. :(
Oi, @ArmoredWarstuck at Authenticating, please wait. It was fine an hour ago.
@sn00ze81 Thanks dude! New rig so far is good stuff :D
if you're thinking, boy can circon shut up about fps and awithwot. NO I CANNOT ITS MY BDAY AND I GOT A NEW PC :D
Scratch that, i just played a game. AW on ALL ULTRA, dipped below 60 fps once or twice BUT was mostly 100fps+ WILST ACTIVELY PLAYING. :O
AW ALL ULTRA = 75-85 fps wilst moving, 160 fps waiting on countdown xD
I probably will stream a little bit tonight, to test things out, gaming wilst streaming is an entire diff. beast ofcourse.
For the lulz, lets check out AW on full ultra. :)
Very Textures - rest on high is at it lowest, 70 fps wilst moving, shooting, stuff exploding.
Alright with Very High textures and rest on high, @ArmoredWarruns at 120 to 160fps :D
@wontcatchme Yes, i thought that was off. My bad :)
Weirdly enough, @ArmoredWarseems to cap at 59-60FPS on both high and very high settings? XD
@VersiGaming: @SirCircon new rig so powerful, shells can't penetrate.
@SirCircon and yes, that is indeed a steel wall medal, on a AMX CDC.
All max WoT (even the things you dont want, motion blur etc,) 75-80FPS in water, things blowing up etc. 115 at start of game/nothing happens
DAMN i also lost my art folder, as in, good looking pics/inspirations/scifi/skulls etc. Sigh. Gimme a cool background bois
XD I forgot how many things had auto log in on my old pc, i think i've reset about 5 PWs lol
@GingesLife Awww candles in GIF form, you shouldn't have ;3
If you do so, you just might up in the image slide show on stream (BRB screen,starting screen etc!)
Hey gang, send me your best World of Tanks / AW screenshots without an UI! with an IMGUR link with your favorite screenshot :)
@AarontheMack my E: disk seems to have ripped. :&lt;
Fuck, just realised, i also lost my t-shirt design file. It was pretty basic like the t shirt tho, so should be done for friday :)
This also means i have to redo all my graphics etc. Luckily i have the Adobe Creative cloud. :)
Well PC rip, New PC should be here tomorrow. Hopefully i can get everything sorted for the friday stream.
Ohhh at this hour, the lower tiers in @ArmoredWar are really good fun. Almost always +0/-0 games :D
@GamerWTGF No, next week hopefully in time for my bday :D
@Haedor1 Nice! Now you realised, you need a 3rd :D
@devinread123 Goodluck with the missions Devin! Their a pain
Been playing WoT for 3 hours or so, i think i had the posibility of doing the missions mayby 30min of that. :(
@eeelliottttt Havent seen that, atleast not since starting this missions. Missions are all RNG.
@AstaLawl Didnt knew World of Warplanes was made in 1999.
Wait, i got it, PERSONAL MISSIONS IS WORSE THEN WORLD OF WARPLANES. #Theultimatetweet
I should probably not tweet right now, so one last thing: Fuck Personal Missions, almost all are: SPAWN ON CORRECT MAP, rather then skill.
Mines = shit map, Mines in tier 10 = completely broken, Mines in tier 10 with arty = KILL ME NOW. Whos idea was it to put that in high tier
Pretty sure even apexis grinding is more fun then these missions. #DATREFERENCE?
You'll be please to know, that i would have had medium missions 15 if I DIDNT FUCKING BOUNCE A 50B TWICE IN THE TURRET WITH FULLAIM FUCKRNG
Whelp, here i am, trying to do the worlds most RNG missions in my off stream time for World of Tanks. Sigh. Such bad design.
Whelp, things like this, make me realise i need the new rig soon, ordering next week, hope to have it in by thursday ready for bday stream!
Okay, wtf, now it loads into windows, i can choose user, then loads into a black screen with my mouse cursor i can move.
For a fresh install, not sure how i can fix this atm.
Well PC update: Seems like windows 7 is just rip, bios still working, sees all the disks, but it doesnt seem to run my cd drive with windows
I think there might have been like a power outage, my pc is enterily fucked. :(
@blkhks True that! Reallllly trying to finish them wilst not getting to salty, but man its tough. :)
Cant wait to be done with these World of Tanks Personal missions, the most unsatisfiying grind i've ever done in any game.
@Murphy1up You should really consider manually tweeting sir. :)
Getting sooooo tired of playing WoT game for 8+ minutes, where you dont have a chance of doing your highly specifik personal mission :&lt;
@sn00ze81 @SirFoch@ArmoredWarShould be working now, lets go do some PVE dailies
@Murphy1up I knew my fellow countrymen wouldnt let me down
@Murphy1up :D Sorry i couldnt be there this time! Also, you should go to amsterdam once!
@billywarren007 Nice, i can finally pretend to play Warthunder, but only do customs and dont grind myself, just play press account.
@EAStarWars I'd love to play your game in PVP but all i get is ''Could not find server.'' and i can PVE with a party(online) just fine.....
Tip for @ArmoredWar people joining today and; in general, doing dailies in PVE is worthwhile, specially in hard mode.
Weow, World of Warships is becomming really boring, everyone is playing the ''lets sit back untill the end of times try to make 18km+shots''
Retification: its ONLY been 832 days, patch 8.6 since arty class changes. @wargaming_net
@TboneIsGaming @SirHavocTv @wargaming_net They limited it to 5 arty each team, introduced tier 9-10s
1167 days Since the last patch that effected Arty Class, its time @wargaming_net to for another patch.
@Excalizorz 1. There was no race 2. I stopped missions after getting the T55A for a long time. GG
@Dutchcucumber1 Woot, then we got ike 250 followers in like a week?!
Oh my, breaching trough the flank and getting to Two Arty pieces in your terminator, 3rd person, tear them to pieces, is amazing!
Thanks for watching everyone, roughly 850 viewers constant today, hopefully that will be 1k+ soon! :D
@Murphy1up @billywarren007 Cool cool, i always loved the krieg dudes from FW
@Murphy1up The one thing i dont like, is the 2 TAU sitting in that open topped area on like the chest : /
People really need to go back to basics in WoT. If you're not doing well tier 8+ Go back to tier 5, learn a bit more of the basics.
@ArmoredWar: AND WE ARE LIVE! #ArmoredWarfare Open Beta Head Start #HYPE
Streaming AW tonight, even tho its my off day, start around 18:00CET till 22:00-23:00CET. :)
@PhlyDaily You like those nuts dont you Phly. ;)
Hopefully i can sleep for a good 12/14 hours tonight.
@ArmoredWar Just announced OPEN BETA (NO MORE WIPES) starting this thursday for founderpack owners. Might have to stream Thursday then. :)
@tielknight @ArmoredWar Oh snap, so no more account resets once that starts?! :)
There now going to check if they can upgrade/ do something on their side, there going to call back in a couple days..
So my ISP called, apparently, their server CANNOT HANDLE THE UPLOAD. Aka, my stream. 300GB upload in a week, soi am not the only one
@TheThyregod I would love to go sleep, but the workers are here till 16:00 :&lt;
@spostma95 It's good, should get higher pen values on normal and prem ammo honestly. Given the no Limited MM
@spostma95 its 29 tomatos, every game. Also, i am grumpy and playing bad. :&lt; Ugh
Guys, i am taking today off, i am in a horrible mood atm. I got like 20% winrate on the patton type in 7 games, slept bad, killing me softly
@BountyHunter84_ THe T22 apparently during new rampage mode
@BountyHunter84_ Timeframe unknown, i think the Skoda probably next patch as precursor to the CS tech tree.Sherman at any point, sinceprem
@RobinLafontaine I think the channel decided on either M4 Ravioli or the M4 Runaway
@spostma95 Ask the commanders ingame (circ = sn00ze) etc. :)
@Max_SRG Tonight probably start at 17:00 or 18:00. So you at 20:00CET should be fine. &lt;3
@BaronVonGamez @TwitchConSF im sure it will happen sooner or later :)
@BaronVonGamez @TwitchConSF Hope there will be a EU twitchcon at some point :)
@blueoval8950 Jup it's the one ship i recommend buying.
@ArminServati Done all of them a while ago. Just scout missions + MT15 + HT15 to go.
Man these last nine missions for the obj.260 are rough. Knocked down two missions today tho! Got to keep my head up ^^
@BaronVonGamez tits arent suppose to be boring tho. :&lt;
@Big_BuBBa86 really good spot and then die by something really sily.
@Big_BuBBa86 basicly, you enter a bit of space that is hostile, anyone can kill you. You try to find a spot with good loot. I find a really
I found the best relic/data site ever, fail one of the hacks, i die by the dmg the cargo thing did to me. #EVENOOB
@PHJ_Official same thing here, streaming for 3 years, feels like a year
@MichaelKemski still made a pretty big profit :D
@KatCressida Wait what, who are you? You dont even follow me nor Wargaming on twitter?!
@LMR_Mad_Friday @WoTConsole Dont have an xbox, so that is not me. :)
How to make the new jap. heavy tanks worth it: make the tier 9 go 25-30km and the tier 10 35km. Less shitty terrain resist.
Type 4 Heavy the new japanese tier 9 tank heavy takes the crown for the worst higher tier tank.
@Max_SRG @YouTube a drunk man once said: You would think but it doenst
PSA: It's basicly a really bad E-25. ( USA Scorp )(just aced it)
@SirCircon when they know they can play a good amount of time that day. :)
@SirCircon ..i bet a lot of people play during the weekends only, stuff like that. Like @Max_SRG just buy a day of prem when they knowthey..
I dont mind the concept of packages for selling rare tanks. But dont include prem time. Not everyone can make fulluse of 32 days of prem..
@Murphy1up you're welcome, might see you at firstlook aswell, not sure if i am going. ^^
@Murphy1up bring your ps4 to work, do it during your break ^^
@Wargaming_netEN 300+ MS Spike ( a lot of them) on the EU2 Server, havent checked EU1 yet.
I havent forgot, i still want an early overwatch key. HOOK ME UP CIRC FAM
@Glaeqen metal wise, almost all gojira honestly, check my spotify if you wanna check my music taste, link in twitch description
Gojira - Into the wilderness from 4:01 onwards are some of the best sounds ever. ^^
Did not expect the WoWS update to be 1600MB so ill be 5-10 min late. :)
@haterage97 ambience and stuff works just fine for me
@haterage97 i have no clue what it did to turn it off lol
Also getting dangerously close to the best month of the year. Rocktober :D
Maaaaaannnn, diablo and eve got a hold me this week. Still, wot tonight and aim for tier 9 unlockerino! ^^
@eeelliottttt Yes, tho that is just to receive any ISK people want to donate, my normal character name is way different. :)
Thanks so much, reaching 2k+ viewers again felt amazing. Also felt like solo stream is not that bad either? Thanks and ill see you friday!^^
Modpack? modpack? Modpack? modpack? Modpack? modpack? Modpack? Modpack? modpack? Yes, once the mods are up to date and stable for 9.10
Scumbag netherlands, 21 degrees and rain, yay! -100% humidity booo
@worldoftanks it's the FV-Why-not-a-chieftain Tank
@sn00ze81 D'awwwww #Fucksummerthotoodamnhotayyyylmao
@PhlyDaily @WorldofWarships hit me up with them codes son!
@PhlyDaily @wargaming_net @BaronVonGamez For Warships i geuss? :D
@billywarren007 i'd be more worried about your haircut #Heyooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
@NougatPower26 Good point, also not readable on black background. Will tackle that soon
@tsk169 Doing this one atm already, looking for new emote ideas to replace the other slot aswell :)
Because after we fill the last spot of emotes, i think ill trow away the pancake(not much use) and the clipped emote (not readable)
@unitlostgaming @TwitchSupport Probably cus in my mind ''subscriptions'' would lead to a list of people i subbed too.. owell, thanks mate
@unitlostgaming @TwitchSupport This is amazing, every time i want to add emotes etc, i can never find it easily.
Why is it always so hard to find my twitch page where i can add emotes? @TwitchSupport :&lt;
Why is it a super red sky outside in the netherlands? Something explode?
@GoldringLinus No tears, only dreams now. circClap
@Fatkingburn Yes, a smaller audience has its advantages!
Man, todays stream felt really good. Hopefully we can crawl out of the darkness and reach 2k viewers again soon. &lt;3
@BaronVonGamez @PhlyDaily @worldoftanks @PowerHausGaming @slickbee Eh, only first class, no mastery. ;) GG sir
Took 30 minutes to have 2 bad games only because of the arty class. #newrecord
@unitlostgaming True that, my room is directly under the roof. Some summer days it's a damn sauna
@unitlostgaming yeah, i can also run a 2 pc set up with it, wich i intent to get in the future :)
The nice thing about this mixer is that i can use it in a dual pc set up in the future. BEHRINGER XENYX X1204USB
@jochem_alpine Thanks jochem, ill order that asap ;)
Anyone know a good compressor? / Knows there stuff about it? I want a simple one that keeps my mic in check. So my screaming isnt RIP ears.
Watching the @PowerHausGaming Vod for a bit. God damn i love the idea and you all seem like great people.
@sn00ze81 You'd be amazed how many times i checked the store and they'd be sold out. Better late then never hype!
i'm going to have to start a little bit later today, roughly an hour so 18:00CET, playing VERDUN today! :)
@sn00ze81: @SirCircon @SirFoch @PHJ_Official @Max_SRG Help stop the mindless clicking against players, give a damn! Boycot arty! #stopar
Truth is, if no one would play arty, WG would actually have to change things. Arty players just give them the perfect excuse.
@PhlyDaily Do you have like a guest room or something?
Yo, who do i have to kill to live in this new power haus? @BaronVonGamez @PhlyDaily
Hey @Twitch @TwitchSupport - Twitch Partner here, free idea for you: Extra Flair/ Different sub icon for 1 year - 2 year etc subs!#BOYS
@MightyJingles Enjoy your holiday in the USA mate! ^^
Recorded winner and qand;a vid, pc goes crazy, lost all of it. Sadpanda
@Lafeelabriel The tier 4 goes like 25km and only has 35 front armour at best, ayyyy lmao
@Lafeelabriel That are not going to do anything against +1+2MM But time will tell. I Deff think the tier 9 is going to be really good,
WoT PTR Jp Heavies: Probably all suck, except for the tier 9 and 10. I think the tier 9 might be better then the tier 10 tier for tier.
Rain and thunder going ham atm, love it! Bring the cold! ^^
@SideStrafe @WorldofWarships If going to twitchcon was just as expensive as going to tankfest, i would be there in a heartbeat. ^^
@WorldofWarships @SideStrafe If only EU people could sail to twitch con D:
Think ive had enough hot weather to last mea year or 2. Bring on the cold and rain please.
Prettttyyyyy sure. I have a fever for the last couple of days. Been a while since i had that.
@BaronVonGamezHappy B-day buddy. Was in gamescom, missed your tweet! ^^
@M_A_Gonz Last PM on FB i can see is from saturday!
@sn00ze81 @PHJ_Official @SirFoch nice, so how many credits did you make selling that trashcan on tracks
@sn00ze81 earth wind fire and rain, fucking magnets, how do they work
@AP_0404 car? You mean those yellow once that drive you around right? ;)
Woot, they managed to get another train, no delay, new train hype
Nice... 2 hour delay on my fucking train. Cmon man, i could have mayby streamed if not for this delay T_T
FYI ill be at wg booth at the end of the day! 17:30ish probably!
@Max_SRG good stuff, never tried kilkenny before, also pretty good!

After a 5 km walk, we found a new irish pub that doenst only have kolsch!
Hey all, today no gamescom, whats cool to see in koln outside of the dom? Let me know! Go go go
@Miehrano yeah tonights community party is apparently on a boat, hence the limited spots.
Holy shit, my shirt is 100% wet from sweat, gamescom wg party was great fun! Thanks for getting us invites @Wargaming_netEN @Murphy1up ^^
Heading outto get a breakfast, then gamescom day 2! It might be handy to set a time to meet you guys, so today 17:00 WG booth?! ^^
@themainmf yes, only day that i am not at gamescom is sunday
Played @PlayOverwatch @overwatcit was fucking amazing. Realllllly want a early key.

HOLY SHIT BTW, I REAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLY WANNA GET MY HANDS ON OVERWATCH. first time playable in eu @ gamescom :D
@PHJ_Official you rerolled your twitter account?
On the first train! Omw to the second one that will bring me to koln. Gamescom trip has started! ^^
That moment, when you are packing for a trip and the question: ''Did i pack X item'' is answered with:''Fuck it, i can buy one there probs''
@BaronVonGamez never been to either of those. Obviously egx is better cus its nearby. :)
@BaronVonGamez thanks dude! We should deff meet at tankfest or gamescom etc. Sometime! Along with @PhlyDaily
@SideStrafe: Enter the code ALBANY on the World of Warships website for a free tier II premium cruiser!
Thanks a lot for watching, viewer numbers today where really good. &lt;3
@BaronVonGamez marrying @PhlyDaily calling it now. ^^
@Max_SRG @Murphy1up damn you max, now i want Garlic Bread
Trying to play tier8 and lower for the fire missions, i am painfully reminded that WoT should be played at tier 9 and 10. :)
Alright, so i cannot take a shower, clean my kitchen stuff to make food. How the fuck do people wake up without a shower? ordered some food.
Alright, well replay #3 is rendering, i might do the winner+Qand;A tomorrow, maaaayby saturday. Well see what happens, goodnight! #CIRC
Well time to record youtube stuff at 04:30 i geuss xD
Yo there might be some delay with replay vid, cus neighbour has water flooding thing going on. Helping her out cus she is panic mode
We got robbed so hard by RNG today, but in the end! WE GOT THE DAMN GUNMARKS! :D
So when is the artillery class in World of Tanks getting a second look? Patch 10.0? (1.0?) @worldoftanks @Wargaming_netEN @Wargaming_NetRU
@PHJ_Official Ive send you rocket league on steam, get your pigeons out
Awesome day today! Thanks for the support! &lt;3
@eeelliottttt That would imply that it's my own gameplay
Update for the modpack: XVM isnt up to date yet, the nightly build crashes WoT every so often. Also the zoom-out mod is not working yet. :)
I am EXTREMELY happy with the preformance increase in @worldoftanks | 60-70+ FPS wilst streaming on the same old rig. GG. @Wargaming_netEN
@JuvonenNiko Dude, looks like a nice landscape! :D
Im not one to cancel streams, but i have to cancel tonights stream. Have a great weekend, see you monday! ^^
Oh my god its nice and cold out, i might actually sleep longer then 4 hours o/
@Tbbalfour jup one of my fav models in wh40k infantry

For my loyal twitter followers some AW keys: AWCBT211794W4KT7 nAWCBT211PRARZ1IYnAWCBT211PVSPUWND
Dont know if you guys heard, but it's pretty hot outside.
Time to watch some netflix and chill out, as much as i can in this heat anyway :D
Waiting on youtube vid to finish uploading then we go live with WoT!
@Murphy1up @sn00ze81 Probably the tilt shift camera angle
@GTThrawn So many music vids with that clip. Better to describe the song.
@jochem_alpine Yea, you should go! More CIRC in 2016 :D
Anyone found a solution to the team list bug in WoT? I recall seeying it yesterday in chat, cant seem to find it.
the fuck, i slept fo 5 hours, feeling ill and zombie like. Fuck this weather
The upcomming @Diablo patch is looking great! Wonder when S4 starts. ^^
@billywarren007 atleast you're actually picking on people of your own size Willy.
Also, if there are any people around that can make my idea of a t-shirt / hoodie art piece in illustrator/photoshop, hit me up!
Damn woke up at ten today, did tankfest do the impossible? Do i now have a somewhat normal sleep schedule? Dun dun dun
@fattygoodness @Max_SRG @sn00ze81 @billywarren007 awesome photo!
Sooooo... who's up for tankfest 2016?! I am ^^ absolute brilliant weekend! @Wargaming_netEN #tankfest
Breakfast almost done, then second day #tankfest ! As always, dont be shy, come say hello! ^^ #circ
The CIRC fam is out in full force, it was a pleasure talking to all of you! Cant wait to meet more tomorrow! awesome seeying all the t-shirt
My god, #tankfest is blowing my mind right now. Real eye opener, feeling really inspired and excited about the future.
@WorldofTanksEU: #Tankfest2015 starts today at the #TankMuseum! If you're heading down, be sure to go speak with the WG team there at ou
@Max_SRG @Murphy1up @sn00ze81 @PHJ_Official @billywarren007 ah good you found prehistoricphonedjedi

@SideStrafe Casual, my sabot been up for 9+ hours! ^^
@SideStrafe @Bis18marck70 @unitlostgamingif you wanna play some AW on EU server, hop on my TS. Doing a 31Hour AW stream :)
@BountyHunter84_ Honestly, just glanced at it, doenst look to bad. The tier 10 med buffs seem intresting? better reload, aiming times, bloom
Hey @Murphy1up I tried to DM you but your not following me on twitter. Can you hop on skype for a sec?
@SideStrafe Because XBOX version is made by Wargaming WEST not RU. Luckily they seem to have some creative freedom for their version! ^^
@ArmoredWar Its the hotfix for the reload bug i reckon? :D
guys.. guys listen. LISTEN.. WHAT IF WE TAKE THIS LOBSTER then SLAP a ''CANNON'' to it. Then try to sell it on ebay as a conversion
@DennisdePee Wich is something @ArmoredWar seems to actually understand
Apprently it IS possible to get new twitch subs during AW! Welcome Cpt_Blazkovic ! :D
@PHJ_Official @PhlyDaily @SirFoch @sn00ze81 @BaronVonGamez @Bis18marck70 CASUALS EVERYWHERE
@ArmoredWar: EU server is currently experiencing issues with authentification.We are actively working on correcting this issue. Current 
@DennisdePee Just like all the other multiplayer games, where you get punished for getting better at it. OH WAIT THAT DOENST FUCKING HAPPEN
@BaronVonGamez 4 man party game, warioware mixed with super smash bros. : )
Anyone up for Duck Game around 2100CET? @PhlyDaily @PHJ_Official @SirFoch @sn00ze81 @BaronVonGamez @Bis18marck70 I got 3 copies left
I've said this before, but 95% of WoT Epic replays on youtube are those without arty or when arty didnt focus them down. myself inc.
@CrumplezoneRW_()_/ soooo EU gets it a month or 2 later...because... it was only streamed and meant for US people? _()_/
@izdareapr That's because WoT XBOX is being made by Wargaming WEST and not Wargaming RU
@jochem_alpine Yea saw that! Not to worried about it
twitch servers are rip! But it also time anyway, so ill see you people tomorrow :)
@worldoftanks What? You're finally fixing the arty class? In just a few days? HYPE. #kappa
DUDE HOW IS THIS THE LAST EP OF GOT THIS SEASON WTF xD
Jesus Christ @PhlyDaily please turn that shit off and just manually tweet pancake :P
@PhlyDaily Yes, i am playing on EU server only tho. 17:00 to 21:00CET ^^
Honestly, AW is keeping my spirit up! Loving it atm! :D
Praise RNGesus, it's not as hot outside as it was yesterday. o/
Thanks for playing guys: @SideStrafe and; @Bis18marck70 ! Was a lot of fun! GG.
@Twitch: . @YouTubeGaming Welcome Player 2. Add me on Google+. #kappa
Well i think i have to reinstall xsplit, hopefully everything will be fine by friday T_T sorry people :&lt;
Saw your message to late, ill be up for AW on friday EU test time tho! @SideStrafe ^^
Going live at 17:15 ish cus of keyboard stuff :&lt;
@muston3 yeah wanted to get corsair at somepoint affraid i cant get those right now tho
Hope i can find a decent one, other wise im going to have to order another one for long term
@SirCircon spilled my drink, r i p razer black widow ultimate 2012 - 2015
Fuck just killed my keyboard, heading to shop right now
@PHJ_Official @Murphy1up Yeah, im sure he will tell you about that Jedi xD
Probably playing Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine and mayby besiege? If you have any other cool ideas to play tonight, lemme know :)
The trailer honestly had this aprils fools (WoWP) vibe to it if you never played the original, which i did not.
@TheDarkem The up north part is 100% worse then the old school one tho. Atleast city and other parts got some improvements. North=fucked
@TheDarkem They can just swoop in from north is what i meant.
@TheDarkem Well yes, but then you get flanked by the unspotted tanks up north. Also, some tanks need some kind of hull down position
That does not make any sense. IF you go there, itsdice roll between arty, if you dont go there, you get flanked hard.
@AndyinBrum to +2. BUT ONLY IF THE MM HAS A ROUGH TIME FINDING +1. So at release, it should be less of a issue.
@AndyinBrum Jup, they stated that because it was a test and they didnt have enough people playing, if it takes to long, you will be matched
@NeutronRaptor Also, if you want to bitch about my bitching, why even follow me let alone respond to me. You dont have to read my tweets :)
@NeutronRaptor So i would like to see it get better. Twitter also might not be for you, if you dont want to read opinions lmao
@NeutronRaptor I probably will move to AW. Its just in testing phase right now, so i cant play it 24/7. Also, i care for WoT.
Like spawning in your tier 6 and in your team there is tier 7 scouts, just feels like a knee to the balls
So you're a new player, and you reach tier 3, then get shat on by tier 5 KV-1 etc. Doenst that feel like getting punished for trying thegame
I see absolutely no reason AT ALL for tanks not to have +1 MM to atleast tier 5. If they're not going to do all tiers.Tier 3 vs 5 is sad.
Atleast @ArmoredWarwill put -1/+1 MM into play.
Not to mention... tier 3 vs tier 5.. I mean talk about fucking over new players.
No one is having fun playing tier 6 against tier 8. Its high time we get +1/-1 MM. We have enough in EU and RU at the very least.
So sick of the -2/+2 MM in WoT right now, played for an hour, had 1 normal MM :(
@Dansgaming: Steam has all the Fallout games on Sale. #ProTip Don't buy the $5 versions of Fallout 3 or New vegas. Those don't include t
CIRC FAM, anyone actually playing FF14 Online? How is it? ALSO I am thinking of hitting up the Games Workshop tomorrow....................
@Tbbalfour uninstall and wait for AW tests Kappa
@PhlyDaily excited DOU? xD Phlydaily = Homer Simpson comfirmed.
@TNotifierApp Hey, how do i add re-sub widget? The Sub widget only picks up like 1 out of 10 re subs.
Holy shit its hot in the netherlands, never was a fan of warm weather, gimme fall/winter! ^^
@combatcotton How close are they to the next gen book for 40k? aka how old is this current one? I think its 7th?
@combatcotton Really? How so, i havent really looked at news that much, just the models.
@Lozzerino88 Yeah, share them pics! I am thinking of getting some tau... mech suits &lt;3
I still have this urge to do something with Warhammer 40k.
Going to have to cancel tonights stream, should be streaming tomorrow tho.
I feel like i should make some giant ass rant video about this
Seriously, how LITTLE FUCKS can you POSSIBLY GIVE ABOUT YOUR BROKEN AS FUCK MECHANICS, I JUST WANT THIS GAME TO GET BETTER FOR FUCK SAKE
God damnit. I dont WANT to be this negative. But jesus christ it's hard not to be at times.
@BaronVonGamez you can, but you need to progress seperate
@BaronVonGamez All my progress is on EU server tho.
Dude after AW, i am so bored with WoT.. its scary.
Starting at 18:00 today for more AW. Mayby WoT after that. :)
@jeanpaul4321 YESSSSS awesome! My fave beer :D Hope you liked it!
@PhlyDaily And shooting with the battelships drove me nuts, but at first i thought i was doing something bad, but just 100% RNG.
@PhlyDaily Nice one, since the 24 hour servers and the 36 hour livestream, i have been saying that aswell. carrier and bb are boring as F
@jeanpaul4321 Nice! once we take texel, we will be closer to world domination! Also, see if they got Pauwel Kwak beer! :D
@SirCircon add it withe its ready. Because all the ingame stuff works :)
So... modpack for WoT is ready, but 1 mod isnt updated yet, its locastans session stat mod. I think ill just release it like this and -
@Dansgaming @WildStar all i hear about wildstar for months now, is that the servers are pretty empty.
@Dansgaming: I really hope @Bethblog's E3 announcement makes me FALLOUT of my chair
@Tbbalfour You know, that wouldnt be so bad if the lyrics where gone!
Thanks for watching everyone! Been a good streaming chain for a couple days now! ^^
Still in the city shopping for some birthday gifts, so might be a tad late today
GUYS I NEED TO FIND A STUDIO RECORDING OF THE FLAMETHROWER GUITAR GUY SONGERINO from mad max fury road
LISTEN, i am going to be late today, because time seems to fly today. Roughly an hour late.
@BaronVonGamez @totalwararena ahah, i could go, but its a 2 hour+ train +money and shit!
@worldoftanks Oh tips, sell your E5 and get a Obj.140. You can actually work on most maps and mayby get to kill arty every once in a while!
@worldoftanks Pro = it's not a arty piece Con = It's not a obj. 140
@BaronVonGamez @totalwararena are you and twitter not friends anymore?
Been coughing for 2 weeks, its getting less now, but i am pretty sure its the EBOLA from stalingrad map + arty design at this point.
how many years do we need before stalingrad is out of the map rotation? @ru_wargamingnet
@BaronVonGamez @totalwararena I like how you say this, 1 day before the event :P
Damnit, watching @TheGiantWaffle build Warhammer 40k Models on twitch. Now i want to do that aswell. Brings back so many memories!
@billywarren007 looooooooooooooooooooooool, i JUST said that
@San4311 @MightyJingles They grow up so quick :')
@PhlyDaily @BillNye @netflix I'm, still on that M.D House trip xD
@BaronVonGamez @PhlyDaily Yes twice, have some friends there, planning on going again somewhere this year, mayby in october.
@PhlyDaily yeah wtf ahahahahah i also didnt follow @BaronVonGamez yet, obviously foxed now
@NougatPower26 would be even better with healthbar and a - dmg ahah xD
@BaronVonGamez @PhlyDaily @slickbee I am pretty sure playing with your guys is the only way i can enjoy Warthunder rofl
Because of reasons, i am going to have to start at 18:00CET today. So 1 hour later. I am sure you will understand :D
@rickygervais: Trolls don't hate you. They hate themselves. They're in pain and; you getting upset is like their morphine. Don't administer
Second game, Stalingrad map, it's like a poor mans Kharkov. Also pathetic :D
played first game, Swamp. What a absolute pathetic map.
YOU MIGHT TAKE OUR TOG2 BUT YOU SHALL NEVER TAKE OUR SEXTON #savethesexton @Wargaming_netEN
Rendering a video now, ill release it tomorrow midday, otherwise a lot of people will probably miss it! ^^
@insanelybuddy 4150 dmg as you can see in the screenshot :P
Andddddd a hour later, i am reminded why people should just play tier 9 and 10 all day. FUCK THIS +2MM SHIT. 7 games in, only 1 tier 6 MM..
Damn, new battery for my phone. Should have done that a LONG time ago. Well worth the 22eu. ^^
@Cernatlapa Didnt try it yet, since they are prem, i just put my other 4+skill crews in there.
@San4311 Probably/Hopefully. But that still make this a bit weird.
EU does not get the ISU-122 because that would be 3 RUS tanks, RU doenst get the cromwell... NA GETS ALL OF THEM?!?!?!?!
@SirCircon This also means, that if you dont care to much about brothers in arms, you can retrain for sixth sense etc. (for gold ofc)
@MrMcderp the question isnt bad, the lack of reply button however is making my blood boil
@MrMcderp YA, among others, ill just remove them untill i can reply lol
How the fuck do people reply to my youtube videos without them having a fucking reply button #rustle
Rudy Review Vid processing is taking a bit longer then i thought, so ill release it tomorrow :)
Alright Hotel is Booked, Flight is booked. Spending a pretty penny for it, but tankfest should be worth it! ^^
Flying to England is almost more expensive then Sweden?! :&lt;
@SirCircon People not knowning who you are and wn8 of nothing on the account. Just... amazing.

My home phone is ringing. I did not know I had a home phone. Interesting development.

I will always remember today as the day I cooked dinner, rubbed my eyes, and then learned that jalape are NATURE'S PEPPER SPRAY.
@RonanFarrow: Not interested in this Wall Street Journal op ed section unless it's entirely written by Taylor Swift.
Today I had the actual thought:"Time to start brainstorming what Christmas presents to get people!" nThen I realized I may have a problem.
I'll bet that when you see The Giver, you'll come away haunted by several things. One of those things will be Odeya Rush. @OdeyaRush1
Just saw a screening of The Giver. Honestly, I can't believe I got to be a part of something so poignant and beautiful. My head is spinning.
@abiander: 'Cause you're a sky full of stars  Can we talk about how insanely good @coldplay 'Ink' is?!
When my mom says "Think you should brush the back of your hair?", it's really less of a question and more of a call to action.
At a certain level of jet lagged, I just start answering all of my business emails with "I'll do whatever I want."
Never played in Malaysia before tonight and I've been missing out- THANK YOU KL! Only one more show, then no more Red Tour......
@PerezHilton: I seriously feel like my life is one @TaylorSwift13 song after another!
I swallowed a strand of my hair and now everything is ruined.
Great crowd tonight, Singapore! See you again later this week for show #2!
@lordemusic: @taylorswift13 it's because of austin's attempted rule bending #iamascrabblepurist
Super weird how all of a sudden everyone is busy when I text them "hey want to come over and have a Scrabble tournament??"
It's crazy to think about how many countries I've lost hair ties in.
WOAH so it was definitely option A. Excellent work, Jakarta.
I can hear the crowd from my dressing room so either A) Jakarta crowds are the loudest EVER or B) Jakarta arenas have super thin walls.
I'm sending my love to the fans in Thailand. I'm so sad about the concert being canceled.
"If you continue to not take this game seriously, it will continue to not reward you." -@austinswift7 on playing pool with me.

I keep hiding things in secret spots in my apartment and then forgetting where I hid them. Would've been the worst pirate ever.
@jackantonoff: ideally all crowds of all sizes would want to be spoken the way you speak across the table from someone
Lena on @jimmyfallon = the most adorable interview ever and I'm sad that it's over.
@HaileeSteinfeld: There is no easy way of playing off when someone doesn't realize you put your hand out for a high five.

Just landed in my home state- Pittsburgh, see you later on! I'll be the one in the sparkly red shoes singing about my feelings.
I so excited that the new video for  comes out this evening! Also very excited about all the red, white, and; blue happening tomorrow.
In Vancouver- just realized you guys got my twitter up to 30 million followers?!?! So cool considering I only tweet about my cat and food.
@austinswift7: Once met a person who thought the saying "to each his own" was "to each a zone" I didn't correct them and now they're out
So stoked to be playing the first show they've ever had in this stadium tonight- see you soon Winnipeg...
We've lost Chet Flippo, one of my favorite journalists, who devoted his life to writing about music from a place of integrity. So sad.
I'm beginning to think that you don't find happiness from living your life looking ahead or back..that you find it when you look around.
Just took a walk around the stadium we're playing in tonight in Toronto- It took a while. Two nights playing here?? No complaints.
I heard @caitlinbird running through the house screaming. At first I thought she was being murdered. Turned out she saw a rainbow outside.
Thanks @edsheeran for surprising the crowd and coming out to sing 'Everything Has Changed'. Everyone went INSANE. #CapitalSTB
Looking out into a crowd of 80,000 with their phones up, all lit up, was breathtaking. London. I just adore you. #CapitalSTB

That moment when you buy scissors and then you try to open them but you can't because you DON'T HAVE SCISSORS.
@katyperry: I knew you were truffle when you walked in #dinnertime
That San Antonio crowd was amazing and SO loud. Now I'm stuck in my own concert traffic, which is a conflicting feeling.
Oklahoma- the entire crowd in Austin, TX and I have you in our thoughts and prayers tonight.
Played Houston! Then rehearsed in Vegas for Billboards! Then cleaned my closet and concluded that roughly 79% of my shirts are striped.
About to watch the New Girl season finale and I totally would be even if I wasn't in this episode. @NewGirlonFOX

Tampa. You were so loud and dancy, it's gonna take me a while to fall asleep after that one. So I will raid the fridge now. Obviously.
So cool that @bobatl came to the show last night and surprised the Atlanta crowd with 'Both of Us'! Insanely fun.
Atlanta, you were an insane crowd-- see you tomorrow night? Excited.
Sending all of my love to Boston after a day of sadness and confusion and not knowing what to say. I just don't understand.
Woah Miami! That was so much fun!!! After a week away, I'm so stoked to be back on the #REDtour.
Just got to Vegas for the ACMs-- fun fact: today is the last day to vote for entertainer of the year and voting during the show counts most!

Can't believe I'm getting ready for the first show of the #RedTour. (!!!!!!!!!)

Hey so....... @GMA is going to be previewing the video for "22" tomorrow morning. 7 a.m. on @ABCNetwork:)
The 22 video premieres AND the Red Tour starts on Wednesday! Yes, that's the 13th. Yes, that's on purpose.
Just watched This is 40 in my hotel room. @MaudeApatow, you are amazing and I actually clapped after every one of your tantrums. So good.
Driving home, Maroon5 "Daylight" came on and I was screaming the 'WOAH's so loud the people in the car next to me thought I needed help. So.
Cannot. Wait. To perform on the #BRITs2013. It's tonight on ITV at 8pm. 
(BRITs rehearsals!)
@edsheeran: @taylorswift13 I don't know about you, but I'm feeling pretty damn 22 right about now
So. One of my favorite human beings on the planet turns 22 today. I hope @edsheeran has the most perfect show in LA tonight! HAPPY BDAYYYY
So grateful for the 5 Academy of Country Music Awards nominations I got today. And happy that it's the 13th. And thankful for you.
@taylornation13: "I Knew You Were Trouble" AKA number ONE song in the country for the 4th straight week...
Leaving LA now after the best day with my friends. Almost forgot it was a video shoot. Can't wait for you guys to see it.
WE JUST WON A GRAMMY FOR SAFE AND SOUND!!!!!!!!!!
Favorite Grammy day moment so far: sitting in my dressing room with Sir Elton, watching @EdSheeran play new songs on his guitar.
Long day of rehearsals and;fittings for Grammys (stoked). Now I'm in bed at 8pm (again) and (still) blaming it on jet lag from the Europe trip.
I sang with Tim McGraw on a song on his new album- it's called 'Highway Don't Care' and it's out now and I'm psyched about it- check it out?
So I'm just minding my own business, making a sandwich before rehearsals, and I get a call that Red is platinum in the UK. I LOVE you guys.
@AshleyMGreene: Pretty sure I'm obsessed with @taylorswift13 song "The Last Time"
Thank you to all the fans in France and Spain for making this trip so lovely. Headed back to  now!
Tonight was my first time at the 40 Principales Awards in Madrid and it was amazing! Thanks to the fans for the International Artist Award:)
Quick photo shoot in London and now we're in Madrid. BFF status to @edsheeran for hooking up my friends with tickets to his nashville show!!
It's official--'I Knew You Were Trouble' is #1 on pop radio!! You guys are unbelievable. I'm smiling SO big right now.
Hey everybody, Michael J. Fox got in touch with me today and we are good. Thank you for having my back.
BRIT nomination?! Amazing!! 
Sitting here with my new People's Choice award and Chinese food take out, watching Law and Order. Thank you for a beautiful night:)
So excited to be in New York playing on @OfficialNYRE! It all starts at 8pm ET on ABC. Can't. even. verbalize. how stoked I am for 2013!
I shouldn't read into the fact that my family got me a new scrabble board (the one that swivels!) and;cat treats for Christmas, right? Am I 85?
Hiiii @lilyrosecooper--thanks! That just made my day:) Merry Christmas!
@lilyrosecooper: This Taylor Swift Trouble jam is siiiiiiiccck.
Was just thinking about how amazing it is that @ReeveCarney did all of his own stunts in the 'Trouble' video. So unbelievably talented.
I'm heartsick about the senseless tragedy in CT and praying for the families of the children and teachers who lost their lives. Unthinkable.

Just tried reading a hotel shampoo bottle an arms length away from my face to check if I still need contacts-Turns out I do. Eventful night.
Today my friend @RichardWilkins made the astute observation that 'Meredith' contains 'Red'.  I was astounded. And the fans were amazing.
Now we're off to Australia, where @GrantMickelson will undoubtedly refer to koalas as 'panda bears' no matter how many times we correct him.
Leaving Tokyo. I'll miss you guys. Thank you for your lovely hospitality and cat-related gifts. :)
Last night my band, crew, and I ate Japanese food and went around the table saying what we're thankful for. I could've gone on for an hour.
Time to play my nightly game of "where are the light switches in this hotel room?"
Landed in Japan a few hours ago- thank you to all the wonderful fans at the airport for your adorable gifts and adorable-ness in general :)
Thank you so much for the AMA! You're unreal. I went straight from the awards to a night video shoot. Long day but so worth it.
Getting ready for the AMAs! Maybe if you feel like it, you'll watch? 
Walked into my AMA dressing room and there was this little bowl of candy in there. Literally shrieked with excitement. Need to tone it down.
Had a blast playing on #xfactorUSA. Also, @Ddlovato's hair looks SO good tonight.
I'll be on @TheXFactorUSA tonight at 8 ET on FOX. So stoked.
Such an insane night!!! You guys won me 3 EMAs! Best female, best live act, best look. Can't even begin to thank you enough. I love you!!

Highlight of my night: hearing the whole Vancouver crowd sing "She's So High" when Tal Bachman came out and sang with us tonight!
The crowd tonight in Tacoma was gorgeous. And 20,000 strong. I can't stop smiling.

Searching for my glasses, a task that would be so much easier if I only had my... glasses.
The dairy queen commercial where Mary Lou Retton falls out of the pi is just so amazing. #isitweirdthatirewinditandlaughhysterically
Yeah, there are all sorts of fun things to do while sick and on vocal rest. Like sitting here, popping bubble wrap by myself.#wishiwasontour
Louisville, I so sorry to have to postpone this show to Oct 11. This is my first time having to do this. I'm so, so sorry.
@caitlinbird is pacing back and forth in the dressing room, deeply distressed that she left her coloring book and crayons at home.Seriously.
@GrantMickelson: Woah, yer tellin' me I just played for 110,000 people in less than 48 hrs? We can safely say that the people of Mass ...
Writing letters, giving haircuts, signing cd covers. Backstage activities.
Tonight I got to dance in the pouring rain with 52,000 people. I will NEVER forget it.
In my dressing room getting ready to play Gillette Stadium tonight. I can't for the life of me believe that we're playing here tomorrow too.
Pittsburgh, you made us feel like we have 52,000 new friends. I'm so happy and proud that my home state provided such an AMAZING crowd!!
Just played the last night of CMA Music Fest (um,you guys were amazing!!). Then I went home and baked until 2:41 AM.
To the 50,000 people who came to our show tonight at Ford Field, I'm going to be replaying tonight for a long time. You. Are so. Awesome.
@GrantMickelson: Sorry to hear that, @TaylorSwift13! :( I got a feelin' that tonight wasn't gonna be a good night.
I was like 'I get to sing with Fergie in NYC?!' and then there was rain and lightning and they're like 'it's cancelled' and I was like :-(
@ChaeLynne: So, I may or may not have eaten jr mints instead of brushing my teeth tonight. It tastes the same, doesn't that count?
Ahhhh!!!! I'm jumping up and down in the dressing room, so stoked about the Video of the Year award!!! Thank you! Thank you! You guys...!
The CMT Awards are tonight!! If you felt like voting for my video at CMT.com, I wouldn't try and stop you :) :)

I'll be live with @realsway today at 7:53 pm ET on MTV to premiere "The Story of Us" video! Tweet ?'s with #askTaylor and I'll answer them:)
At the Billboard Awards in Vegas! About to go find my seat. Got "Waking Up in Vegas" stuck in my head, @katyperry.
I had the absolute time of my life playing our new show in Nashville tonight. I can't even thank you guys enough.
Make up, stretching, warming up, running around saying good luck to everyone.. Speak NowithHelp Now. Nashville! I'm excited.

"Ya gotta keep your head up OHHH, but you can let your down EHHH" @andygrammer on the radio- Singing along on the way to rehearsal. Smiling!
...And I got to tell Jimmy Fallon how awesome his 'Whip My Hair' sketch with Bruce Springsteen was.
Headed back to Nashville after the MET Ball in NYC. Wondrous, magical, fantastic gowns EVERYWHERE. I had a really wonderful time.
We're at rehearsals watching videos of the tornadoes in Tuscaloosa. Our love and hopes and thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected.
Ahhhh!! Story of Us just came on the radio! I'm dancing around my apartment!!
6 days from now my internet connection will be faster than my typical USB 3.0 hard drive transfer speed. Not sure what to do first.
Wait. Catch me up. Who the hell is Milo Yanadjddodlfkjwelkfdj;kjefkjnbckdhfjdhasd32hdnkjn?
@ProducerSnafu Haha. That's a pseudo-effect. I usually use 4 tracks for the real thing.
@mplsmodular Yeah, I probably wouldn't eat it much otherwise as it isn't very healthy.
@mplsmodular ...but I don't judge anyone on their diets or anything. I realize this is a weird personal thing of mine. :)
@mplsmodular I only eat animals I'm comfortable personally slaughtering. Pigs are a bit too smart for me to feel okay with.
My take away from this last month of traveling was personally experiencing constant, non-anecdotal, firsthand evidence of climate change.
My hotel's security just called to ask if I'm safe/alive. #thanks? #chicagostuff
@arielmanticore I believe it's a free university event.
Just floating around an auto show listening to early choral music.
Wait. Why is there so much hay in Chicago all of a sudden? I keep seeing clumps of hay everywhere.
Chicago! Tonight. Chill venue. Great sound system. Music begins at 8pm. Everything wrapped up nicely by midnight. See you there! @Schubas
Playing at a Masonic Lodge tonight in Rockford, IL. For info text "flashbulb" to 31996
Motel 6's "renovations" = sleeping in the section of Ikea you go to when moving into your first apartment with $32 in your checking account.
First day traversing from the west coast to the midwest and we're already completely snowed in. This week is going to be a shit one. :-
Also, my set tonight begins at 9pm! Doors at 8:30.
Just got busted sucking back a coffee flavored nicotine-free ecig in a public bathroom stall. Portland deserves better, I'm sorry.
OMG can anyone please read a Wikipedia article before publicly screaming about how "America right now is EXACTLY like 1930's Germany".
In other news, tonight in Portland should be epic with @Plaid !
Minneapolis was canceled for 2/11. My agency and myself did everything possible to avoid the cancellation. Replacement gig coming for 2/11.
Before you line your bar with "ABLEISM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED" signs, you should maybe consider making it handicapped accessible.
I just realized that every single time I've ever been in Seattle, I've been bowling. #ThanksObama
My green room is about a $7 Uber trip from the stage.
Tickets for my show in San Francisco tonight have sold out!BUT, if you arrive early, there should be some available at the door.
I apparently cannot go on tour without my debit card getting hacked and subsequently destroyed. 
When you travel for a week and take a glimpse at Facebook, everyone sounds like they're cranky from not eating and drank too much coffee.
I've never seen LA this cold and rainy before. Seattle better be 75f and sunny next weekend to make up for it.
None of my devices can seem to agree on what time it is.
PHOENIX! I am delighted to be playing my first show in nearly 2 years here on Saturday! Remember, the show begins earlyish at 7:30pm!
Would you still buy a shirt at my merch table if it got fired at you point blank from a t-shirt gun?
Am I seriously the only person who doesn't give a shit that a traveling circus went out of business?
@Harilton1994 I would suffer less consequences if I snitched on a drug importer.

@lyden_modus   !
Those Russian prostitutes who got to pee on Donald Trump are the envy of the world right now.
@protman Honestly, I'd go with BJJ. It's low impact, competitive to a degree (fun and addictive), and you can spar without getting injured.
I never thought I'd have a Twitter meltdown over Meryl Streep. I figured it'd be Comcast or Apple or something.
@BringBackBenoit She's someone speaking to the world about xenophobia while being xenophobic.
@chasedotwav "If you kick em all out [foreigners], you'll have nothing left to watch but football and MMA, which are NOT arts"
I've seen SO MANY gang members/addicts/abused people's lives transformed by martial arts. They're not high class enough for #merylstreep 
Why did #merylstreep throw dirt on a sport derived from cultural arts and overwhelmingly dominated by foreigners, minorities, and women?
Imagine what I could achieve if I could format the part of my brain that allows me to annoyingly identify samples in everything I hear.
State of emergency declared in GA. Should I go get gas, canned food, or ammo? Correct answer: a haircut.
You know it's time for a haircut when you look in the mirror and see the owner of a successful Indian restaurant.
Whoops, sorry. SF tickets for sale on FRIDAY THE 6th at 10am. I just learned to read and write on Tuesday, cut me some slack.
I hope that sound is rain outside and not someone pouring gravel all over my house.
My grandpa delivered the most powerful anti-alcohol argument I ever heard: "I just don't get it. I'd rather spend my money on a milkshake."
What is this mental illness people have where they upload tutorial videos explaining how to play songs they don't actually know how to play?
@helloteresa_m If they don't sell out on tour, most likely.
I'm just a simple man who wants a simple small MIDI controller that sends CC data. But I'm decrypting hex charts and inhaling solder fumes.
Does jogging while pushing a stroller on an old sidewalk violate the "never shake a baby" protocol?
@jen_prokop this guy clearly never took antidepressants.
Just a quick reminder that there's only 73 supermoons left this year.
When I was a kid, Kickstarter was called The Sharper Image. They sold the same useless crap, but it actually existed and you could have it.
TIMESHIELD is a pretty epic name for a laminating pouch.
I may destroy my phone because it keeps destroying me at chess.
Tornadoes are WAY more terrifying when you're surrounded by miles of thick, 250ft tall trees.
I need your support. Talk me out of buying a DSI Prophet 12 desktop module. Please. I don't need it. I need it. But I really don't.
@DiggersFactory: Hey @bennjordan, look what just arrived in our mailbox! Thx to all the Diggers for their contribution. #TheFlashbulb #V
Now wtf am I supposed to do with all these flags?
I was really impressed to see that I could now live track a UPS truck delivering my package on a map. Only because it's so pointless.
Is Quantum Break worth 8-10 hours of my time? (so 12 hours, I'm a very stealthy and boring VG player)
Lots of Thanksgiving-shaming on social media this year, I reckon.
Of course I look this way to help fight cancer. You didn't think I was just too lazy to shave, did you? Psh...I'm heroic. #NoShaveNovember
The Octatrack has been fired from my live setup. There's not an scuba suit that can support 60-90 minutes of menu diving that deep.

If you were robbed or attacked in France this week, know that law enforcement spent WAY more resources making sure people didn't share music
What bugs me personally: Where is my say in this shit? At one time I had the most downloaded album on the site, and I uploaded it! #whatcd
Jesus christ, doesn't French law enforcement have more important problems than their citizens sharing and recommending my albums? #whatcd
My dog is getting nervous while sensing my silent but manic frustration of navigating the labyrinth of an Office365 activation.
HEY! Go get a flu shot if you haven't already. Thanks.
I love how the penalty for running late and bringing my dog for a walk too close to twilight is being stalked by wolves.
Trying to live as long as I can before knowing what a bitmoji is.
@helloteresa_m Hey! Not yet, but we're finalizing the route. Where are you located?
Trying really hard not to spend the week explaining how the electoral college works over and over on Facebook.
@acid_rain ...and they've had a pretty shit leader for a while there.
@acid_rain Well, to just go to an extreme metaphor: Germany is by far the wealthiest and most stable country in Europe.
America survived a revolution, civil war, depression, world wars, and many terrorist attacks. We'll survive this. We'll come out stronger.

Why do fans send me dick pics on Snapchat? I'm not screaming and throwing my phone across the room, nor magically turning gay. Y'all aliens.
If I were pres, I would make a law making it legal to punch anyone wearing an anon mask in the face, so long as you're striking the mask.

@RichardDevine You are the one individual in the world whose life could be destroyed by a kitten.
I bet a good woodworker's personal hell is a job making a bunch of those oversized Jenga games.
I apologize for my saxophone and slap bass assault on Snapchat. I will check into a snap-counseling facility this weekend.
@phoneitindustry Yeah, I follow it. I like how it's a bit more introspective rather than simply trying to stay up to date on headlines.
I've spent much time in recent months trying to grasp the entanglement of ISIS, sectarianism, and players in the region. It's mind blowing.
I was trying to remember the name of the guy who invented Facebook and then realized it doesn't matter.
It's funny that when making music with my own software/synths it sounds more like a mutant EDM than the avant-garde melee one would expect.
Better yet, Gloria Allred is the bowl-cut guy from No Country For Old Men, and the Trump campaign is SW Texas.
Gloria Allred reminds me of is "The Wolf" from Pulp Fiction.
@fallacyfighter What evasion? You're using a power grid and complex network built by the government to troll strangers on Twitter.

@_shan_h Me too. Although I'm never entering that city again between the months of October and April. I'm over the cold.
Also follow me on Snapchat (bennjordan) if you want to see me build the live rig, test out gear, and swear at it. Lots of papillon stuff too

I've been listening to Coil for 20 years now and still can't decide if they're incredible or awful.
At some point the presidential election became the WWE in my mind. I'm genuinely excited to read the news, just because it'll be stupid.
@derekTroberts Yeah. Because fuck those hundreds of thousands of dollars they've made off my music since then.
@ContainerStore @MJMSessions I have considered visiting you to hack and improvise some studio storage/racks in my workshop.
How do you quote a statement that ends with a measurement of inches?
@Tonsko I'm in the research phase. The handle testing phase will be snapchatted. Lots of hype for the "Corona Clipper 60""
Hello, I'm 36 years old and I just legitimately got excited about a new rake.
@TehTechnoGuy I did find out that a lot of splitters (especially the cheap ones) strip it, which makes it cheaper and infinitely easier.
@TehTechnoGuy I honestly don't remember. It's sitting between my TV and Roku though doing its job.
I never had a haircut so bad that I literally just had them shave my head bald afterwards. #NEWEXPERIENCES #awesome #comcastic
@TehTechnoGuy Woops. I meant that the physical CD of it is part of the bundle for top contributors.
For the record, if you "already have everything in the bundle", you've broken into my house and ripped CD-Rs and old IDE drives. Impressive!
It's weird how Iceland's economic collapse has been continually twisted into praise and fake news on social media for 8 years and counting.
@uncollected Vinyl is slllloooow unfortunately (one of the reasons I don't do it often). 7-8 weeks would be a safe ETA.
Listening to music in my car and noticed a slight vinyl crackling sound in the right speaker, but it turns out my dog was just licking air.
@mr12000 There's a bunch of unreleased/white label stuff in there.
@BrendanTraynor &lt;Checks off "Twitter War With Salty Professional Snooker Player" from to-do list&gt;
@krissmasterson I used the #butthurt tag for a reason homey.
@joshuapotter Every single one of them. There's a big difference between point boxing and literally turning your back and jogging away.
I didn't know you could win fights by running away. #ufc202 #butthurt
@acid_rain Oh hold up. I originally read that Diaz was going to get "submitted" by the 2nd round...which is obviously not very likely.
@acid_rain Nate's a legit black belt! I will release a dubstep EP if that happens.
@TehTechnoGuy ah. Yeah it's pretty diverse. I live in the mountains, the east side of the state is loads of islands/swamps/etc.
@TehTechnoGuy Georgia has about 400 miles of coast!
If I see another story about the retro making of the Stranger Things intro which is a stock arp preset in a VST plugin I'm going to explode.
I'm really excited for Katy Perry's next big hit so I can stop hearing that "you're going to hear me roar" track on loop at sporting events.
Films and websites with the word TRUTH in the title are always very accurate, well-sourced, and honest. Especially if TRUTH is in all caps.
@reimer_kettel Unlike superior Uzbekistan, where goats outnumber humans by 0.0003 to 1.
@reimer_kettel Yeah, I wonder what heinous crime that goat committed.
@reimer_kettel I think I play this sport in my yard when my dog is constipated.
My little Steam notifications popup to show my friends opening No Man's Sky every 3 minutes trying to get beyond the title screen.
@reimer_kettel Ervic Gnalgushkininglklyn is clearly using PEDs. No idea how he's passing drug tests.
If that new Behringer synth doesn't have a CRISPR port, I'm not buying it.
@RevFireworks No, but I think what most people are forgetting is the servers being virgins as there was no public beta.
@HipNihilist I have one. It seems like the majority of CC owners suffer the same woes.
I like how when you open Photoshop it's like "dude, wait a bit", so you go to another window, and it comes in all "HEY I'M READY NOW".
I kind of want to make some classic police mystery music.
I got to walk my dog in the woods with some UFC fighters this morning.
Howdy pilgrim. I do declare a Reddit AMA over at r/synthesizers tomorrow at high noon central time. Come wake snakes with us.
@wilw: When a black man, who is a civil rights hero, is talking about civil rights, maybe shut the fuck up for five minutes about the TP
Donald Trump decided to do a Reddit AMA on the same day mine is scheduled. I don't really have a reaction, but I thought I should tweet it.
Another day, another Youtube copyright strike for putting my own music to an unlisted video.
Has anyone ever browsed Wikileaks for more than 5 minutes without being distracted by some dust on the wall next to them or something?
@AphixJS @RichardDevine @ALEC_EMPIRE I'm taking a course on deep learning using TesnorflowithPython to develop something using this principle.
@derekTroberts Yeah this factor will determine how good my bot programming skills are.
Reddit AMA happening next Weds. Unless I die. Then it'll probably be canceled.
I feel like it's been months since I've seen a news story lacking a comment using it to justify overthrowing the US government.
The amount of MIDI foot controllers I've bought and returned this month is getting very close to the total amount of MIDI foot controllers.
@ChaelSonnen Trust me, you don't want to meet him in a dark alley (in Warcraft).
But...please take nothing I say as permanent. Maybe I'll end up pumping them through a different compressor or something and digging it.
Thanks for the input everyone! Not sure I'd want to master analog Acidwolf recordings to MP3/digital. It would significantly change the feel
@qrtzcntrl "A" 303. Plus it was a comp of acid tracks written over the last decade.
@kowka_ota It would be cheesy to release Acidwolf - 2006-2016 in 2017. It'll go to a secret Soundcloud if it loses. :P
Can anyone guess why I found a group of ill-prepared, chubby teenagers lost in a 97f subtropical forest today? I really wish I was joking.
@Harilton1994 Perhaps. Although right now it's not even close!
I'm kind of surprised to see a new release getting outvoted by an old repress. I'll give democracy the rest of the day to decide!
As always, I'll actually need a gig to fulfill your polite requests of "FUCKING PLAY IN UZBEKISTAN ALREADY!!! :( "
What I'm trying to say is: My year+ retirement/sabbatical from performing has recharged me. I also need a new booking agent.
What does a 'The Flashbulb' show look like in 2017/2018? I have too many ideas and need a tranquilizer shot into my neck to focus on one.
My local news updates are either about blacklivesmatter protests, a python that escaped from the zoo, or Pokemon Go. This is a bad recipe.
Somewhere out there, someone is coming back from a long camping trip and is really
Brock Lesnar looks like a bleached Super Mutant.
@RunDaltonRun Just ignore those people. They're likely fully transformed into buggy activist bots that only exist in the cloud.
I'm glad so many people are pointing out on social media that sniping police officers is wrong and totally uncool. Haven't considered that.
When I was a kid I asked my grandpa to get flavored Listerine and he laughed and called me a sissy. I still buy yellow because I'm no sissy.
Don't forget to salute our veterans tomorrow by mimicking the sound of gunfire and IED explosions near their homes for 14 hours straight.
Just bluescreened 3 automated checkout machines in a row before giving up on groceries this week.
I want to have a super lush complimentary music festival for only music union lawyers and it'll actually just be a giant fire.
It's like if your boss owed you $500 but had to do some paperwork first, so you give a lawyer $5000 to take it instead. #spotifylawsuit
Spotify is the only streaming service/store that acknowledges unmatched royalties, which is why they're an easy target for this cash grab.
Musicians: This NMPA class action against Spotify is crap and you'll end up giving unmatched royalties to lawyers. Know what you're signing.
@ceephax The term battering ram comes from the medieval era where police used trained sheep for raids before wood or rocks were discovered.
*frantically buys things on my wishlist only available from UK shops*
I'm not sure why anyone would expect shooting an AR-15 to be a soothing, comfortable experience. It's loud and unpleasant. It's a GUN.
I should have been more specific in my last Tweet. #iLokSucks
Military folks, do you get annoyed when you see someone hanging out in public in their cammies?
@clumpofsoul Not anymore (for my account). The only solution for me is Swipe.
If you knew that eventually you'd have to install an insecure, resource hog app to message your Facebook friends, would you have signed up?
In GA, right around mid-June is when you stop trying to avoid insects when eating outside and just devour them when they land in your food.
@roobish They would have to rewrite their low level APIs as Swift cannot bridge to them. Not impossible, but this is first I've heard of it.
@hisaac It's not. Scratch would be the obvious start for kids, with a relatively easy move into JS or Python.
@nikoriana Cooking, socializing, basketball, golf, spinning kicks, violin, sax, sketching, painting, cleaning, marathons, massages, chess...
Kids should not learn a walled-garden programming language that is 100% dependent on Apple's overpriced devices and permissions #java #html5
Internet, can I have just 15 minutes to read the news be fucking sad before hearing your personal manifestos on gun laws and Islam?
I think FedEx Smartpost is literally them storing your package for 2 weeks and then shipping it via UPS.
Canon should have a very big problem with the fact that my Nexus 6P is often taking better photos than their 6D.
Why are other people who don't want children offended when someone asks them if they want children? Why is this even a thing?
Last night the @ufc aired a short film praising Muhammad Ali for speaking freely, then life-banned members of the press for doing the same.
A repairman walked through my control room with vocal booth, past racks of gear, past the guitar room, and said "Is music a hobby of yours?"
I have no idea what happened today, but I feel like I should be outraged and blaming someone for something having to do with a gorilla.
To celebrate memorial day, my garage door tension line snapped, pulling rails out of the wall and dumping 200lbs of metal on me.
@ceephax My god. I'm just imagining a datacenter full of rom expansion cards.
Being a street magician for dogs would be an incredibly easy job.
Did ISIS once hold a children's art contest that resulted in that stupid flag of theirs?
That being said I probably shouldn't be tweeting while high on paint fumes.
Whenever I stain or paint wood I fall into an hour long head crisis of if I'm imagining symptoms of toxic inhalation or experiencing them.
@mr12000 @AdlerPlanet @Bandcamp It's certainly being discussed. We'll sort out the logistics once they get the show finalized next week.
4+ hours of new Autechre releasing the same day as Fallout 4 DLC is going to result in a very bizarre Far Harbor experience.
Very few things in life are as fun as being invited to role-play a combative detainee for a police self-defense class.
@nick_lees @AdlerPlanet It'll be on Spotify and possibly Bandcamp once I make a stereo master.
Just bought coffee from a coffee shop decorated with anti-capitalist paraphernalia and slogans. Lots of inner conflict going on there.
@LumpenRadio: @bennjordan is here to talk and play some tracks tonight at 10PM LIVE!
I just paid $55 to park, $12 in tolls, $20/ day for a refrigerator in my hotel room, and have poor cell signal. Guess where I am!!
Targeted advertising is especially punishing when you've researched plastic surgery prices. (non-cosmetic, don't judge me)
Professional tennis could save quite a lot of money by replacing ball boys with dogs.
@AlexTaylor1992 Just finished writing 9 tracks for @AdlerPlanet 's new feature. I should put some of the tracks up soon.
@jessephamel Everything I've done this year so far has been either modular or coding/PD. But U-He's stuff sounds quite nice too.
I accidentally got really good at physical modelling. (with synthesis, not Kohl's catalogs)
"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you," -Lindsey Graham.
Time to cover the window. Step 1, grab leeward cord and jib starboard...
Window blinds may be the most unnecessarily complicated thing in the world.
"Life's too short to be taken seriously" is way more depressing than the person who quotes it on their Facebook profile realizes.
Turns out grapefruits have been hiring shills to give the impression that people think they don't taste like a AA battery dipped in sugar.
Is it absurd that I'm considering watching UFC 197 and Golovkin Vs. Wade at the same time on 2 different screens?
@SaraBlacklock You just contacted me though. That wasn't so hard. :P
Did Conor McGregor tear his ACL or get popped for steroids?
Why am I supposed to be mad that Hillary Clinton likes hot sauce?
Morgan Freeman sounds like he's had a peanut floating around in his mouth for the last 40 years.
So it turns out I'm pretty bad at competing in jiu-jitsu at heavyweight.
Also why do ambulances always have firetrucks with them? Do people start on fire when experiencing a heart attack?
An ambulance just pulled outside and a paramedic ran into my living room. I reckon I should put some address numbers on my house.
You know who lost the debate? Your social media feed.
Heard someone screaming for help in the woods behind my house. Turns out it was some idiot and his 6 year old pretending to be lost.
Got banned from a modular synth Facebook discussion page for saying ***TRIGGER WARNING*** every time I mentioned gate voltage output.
Journal Log.Friday, April 8th, 2014: I may have contracted the dreaded rhinovirus and am amidst a monumental MIDI crisis. Morale remains.
Do carpenters wear cups with table saws? Because I'm feeling like blazing scrap wood missiles are hitting my penis a little too often.
Gasland is a really shit documentary. There, I said it. I feel better getting that off my chest.
I just witnessed someone on Facebook complaining about gentrification in Portland while visiting Portland to find a place to rent.
Reading racist, entitled comments on a video of a man being shot a few blocks from where I grew up is a good time to unplug my cable modem.
I like playing a game where I leave Soundcloud autoplay on after a piano composition and see how long it takes before dubstep comes on.
Hoping to soon read about a Bernie Sanders animatronic RC bird scandal.
oh man. i. am. so. shocked. i can not believe that batman vs. superman was a bunch of hype leading up to a stupid movie. what. a. surprise.
A company that makes its own limited pool of hardware bricking old devices when releasing a product upgrade is not a coincidence. @apple
I am not even surprised or bothered that an iOS update bricked my iPad. I just threw it in an old box in the garage and moved on with my day
Just got a message from Soundcloud saying that if I have a record contract with Sony, they'll pay me for streaming my music. WOWEE GOLF CLAP
Katt Williams sucker punched a 7th grader who happened to have a pretty good understanding of BJJ fundamentals. That's pretty entertaining.
I wish there was a setting for Google Now to disable the "Spoil every television series you ever watched" feature.
Agar.io would be amazing if they openly let people create bots, and it became a gigantic, multiplayer AI programming war.
I used to try and record nature within a vast city. Now I try to record human elements in vast nature. I reckon the spoils are the rare.
Not many worse places for a drone to malfunction than above a vast, alligator-filled swamp.
First world problem. I'm getting pampered with Android N beta on my Pixel-C tablet and now my phone is a pain in the ass to use.
For my Chicago friends proud of turning a political rally into a violent eruption, shame on you. Trump sucks, but freedom of speech doesn't.
@derekTroberts The "used to" sounds so tragic.
I also wonder if the National Wildlife Federation has figured out that selling personal info is how you lose long time donors. Ugh.
I wonder if the National Wildlife Federation has figured out that cutting down trees to send me daily junk mail is quite bad for wildlife.
Just when I actually thought the internet wasn't going to ruin my celebration of @NateDiaz209 victory, vegans stormed in with stunning force
That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. @NateDiaz209 #UFC196 I'm shaking with joy
@UFCSupport @XboxSupport Already missed the first fight due to buffering and stream issues. I hope refunds are being issued.
@acid_rain I also wonder how it achieves ramping without any input from the camera's light meter or settings. It's just an on-off output.
@acid_rain They don't list specs, but I imagine the device itself could be built for around $100-$200 depending on the res of the screen.
@acid_rain They look nice, but way overpriced IMO. I built a controller for my dolly with an Arduino and some scrap electronics.
If you're into sports betting, there is nothing sweeter than casual fans throwing odds out of whack for superstar fighters like Ronda, Conor
@JackSlackMMA: Don't get upset when I mention McGregor trying to injure Diaz's hand in the post fight.
Cooking tip: If you put a wooden spoon over a pot, it boils over on both sides of the spoon.
@BrendanSchaub: If you thought Silva was going to win a decision in the UK against Bisping then you prob. believe in dragons and; movement 
That felt like aliens abducted me and wanted me to feel comfortable so they imperfectly simulated an Anderson Silva fight as best they could
I'm sorry England, no more UFC cards on your soil. What a train wreck.
I used to have a hawk screech as my SMS notification sound. I'm regretting it now that I hear actual hawks screeching all morning.
@kanyewest: Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
Confirmed! Nate Diaz Vs. Conor McGregor in 10 days. Ahhhhhhh!!!
If @NateDiaz209 is fighting Conor McGregor on the 5th, I might have to fly to Vegas if I don't have a heart attack from the announcement.
@Zemnmez True, but few people NEED to use encryption methods beyond what already exists in 3rd party services (Gmail, banks, etc).
Here's an idea, how about Apple allowing its customers enough control over their devices to use their own encryption methods.
@jessephamel I modified an 8-way switch and V-Split. It's 900x simpler than my previous attempts.
After a week of failure...I went out for a drink, had an idea on my way home, and officially made the first arpeggiator in Reaktor blocks.
Same goes for Dr. Dre's "Compton" and its "Apple Music exclusive" period. Art isn't about strong-arming fans into 3rd party memberships.
I'm a Kanye fan, but downloading an album that is only available on Tidal isn't piracy. If you're going to put an album out, put it out.
Can we have a guitar battle on your live stream @MartinShkreli ?
As always. I don't care what Kanye says or does as long as he keeps putting out albums like this.
Happy Valen- Oh wait, everyone is celebrating an old man dying instead.
I like watching women with super long nails trying to navigate around on their iPhone.
I had a zombie dream and I was trying to disconnect their nodes from the sequencer gates controlling them. I'm working wayyyy too much.
Man, Teenage Engineering is really expanding horizons in the world of completely unenjoyable music.
I had no idea giving a TED talk meant strict rules, a week of forced scheduling, bunking with strangers, and charging people 8k+ for tickets
I'm pleased to announce that I'll be doing another original score for @AdlerPlanet this spring.
@derekTroberts Yeah. Like painting swimwear on her.
Why is everyone painting on Ronda Rousey all of a sudden.
@DougFir7 Only if all of them are declarative sentences with question marks at the end?
I want to see people calling people who disagree with them "paid shills" in real life. It'd be way funnier than it is online.
@Surachai You'll be a successful artist once your PR firm, booking agent, and manager fees exceed your income.
Thanks Google for giving me travel times to "The Hot Dog Factory". Whatever the hell that is.
When someone talks about Mercury being in retrograde, act dumb and ask them to explain what retrograde means.
@thesaucem Thanks! Luckily I'm stocked up on MREs and coal.
@BT Strange? Na. It's easier to lie to yourself to feel superior to other musicians than it is to spend a lifetime working to earn a legacy.
Thanks Google Now, but I don't need to "continue researching tracksuits".
Is @netflix taking those of us who have tunneling security on router level into consideration with this VPN ban? This is a bummer.
Not to toot my own horn, but I'm easily one of the most successful electronic musicians in Smyrna, GA.
@hentainiichan I don't see it that much different than getting a driver's license, except that it only took 120 seconds of my life.
@hentainiichanthink just so people can review the laws in regards to flying them once a year. I don't really have a problem with it.
While I was registering a drone and putting my FAA number on the case, my assault rifle and pistol felt so left out and invalidated.
@hisaac I literally just had to build a HDCP stripper this week because the DRM on HDMI was giving me errors watching Netflix.
@hisaac In a perfect world, sure. But the idea of your headphones not supporting a file format or type of stream is nauseating.
I'm building an HDCP eraser/stripper. If it works, will I be going to prison or Kickstarter?
I wonder what a Ugandan warlord's new years resolutions are like.
Just put a banana festering with fruit flies next to a spider web. Good luck douche bags.
I'm into New Years resolutions that make life more challenging, like "No more putting your car in reverse."
Developers: When the top 10 knowledgebase articles on your site are pertaining to activating your software, people spend $1,500 elsewhere.
So @fivesteppath just sent me 45 unreleased tracks and 100% of them are great so far. #labelbossproblems
@TehTechnoGuy Hmm, nothing like a blog post. I mainly use a 6D, a bunch of prime lenses, and a T3i I converted to infrared.
There is literally nothing new to accomplish in the "funny things bums write on signs" genre of comedy.
I want to review everything I purchase online with: "1/10, horrible. It led to me getting constant emails begging me to review it."
@Daveed84 Who knows anymore. I've been literally reading the "threats" on the porch of a rented beachfront house. It'll be hard to upset me.
Just one of those Mondays where some lunatic is demanding bitcoins in exchange to stop vandalizing a Wikipedia page about me.
I'm staying on an island and just ate an orange right off of a tree. But the thing is that it wasn't an orange, it was horrible.
I think Garmin programmed my GPS wrong as a joke.
I hope 2016 has less webcam photos of people holding signs.
Yay! Apparently Yoda listens to my music according to Spotify and Disney. I should return the favor and actually watch a Star Wars film.
@cAuTioNfRiDay No worries. It was one of my good friends and he had the right intentions. It's just ...the internet. :) Thank you again
@MaxCRoser @CHSommers The verdict's in, have your baby in Greenland.
Did this big Windows 10 update include any features other than making me spend an hour setting my file associations back to how I want them?
Nobody told me you have to be a triathlon gold medalist to go for a 3 mile hilly hike with a steadycam.
My first Youtube video ever is a bocce ball sweeping a can of MGD off of @Machine_Drum 's head.
Prediction: Holloway (tko), Nelson (decision), Souza (tko), Weidman (decision), Aldo (submission).
@michaudstudios Yeah, he's my fave by far. His stand up character is so incredibly refined.
@michaudstudios I had passes to his show in ATL.
I'm way too excited about having met Norm Macdonald tonight.
@marc_mysterio Yes, but if you emailed me something regarding a DMCA, I'd forward it to Mark as he's the guy to adeptly deal with it.
I wanted to go to bed early but then realized I forgot how to play The Days Of Wine And Roses, and that's simply unacceptable.
@marc_mysterio Email mark@alphabasic.com. Thanks!
I'm literally lying awake in bed because I can't figure out if I want to side with The Institute or The Railroad.
Watching my Chicago friends get excited about Google Fiber feels like watching someone planning their estate after buying a lotto ticket.
I'd be way more into cooking if super glue was edible.
@Curtis8ca @DarrenSproat I'm going to give my Form/Survey a couple days to marinate and then do a comparison for the rates I'm getting.
@jandawson Time says 0.047, BGR says 0.00047, 9to5Mac says 0.2. I'd be interested to setup an anonymous survey to see what the norm is.
@jandawson Nope. I own 100% of my publishing rights for the content.
@moonwicky Axed up some dead trees and made a little dam bridge. We'll see how it handles a storm!
@jandawson Absolutely NOT accurate data. With trial period rates I would have gotten a few grand. My actual pay is less than an Xbox game.
@HarshilShah1910 @jandawson Didn't they reverse that decision after the outrage? Trials supposedly pay standard rates.
@jandawson Then why were they never more than 10% of Spotify with the 3 different artists putting them in direct comparison per stream?
@reimer_kettel Over what period? Also we live on 2 different continents/regions. Or perhaps they pay based on how many hamsters you know.
@ViveFaux @JonahBaseball @Spotify @AppleMusic @TIDALHiFi Spotify pays well. I'm beyond satisfied with them.
@esselfortium Spotify actually pays me quite well. I'm completely satisfied on that end.
I like how when thinking about comparing people to Hitler, I instinctively decided to look at my Apple Music royalties.
Spotify has paid me $0.006 per stream. Apple Music has paid me $0.00017. Meaning Apple Music pays 2.83% of Spotify's royalty rate.
The results are in! In a 3-month time frame, @AppleMusic has paid me 1.18% of what @spotify paid me. Hanging just below @DeezerFrance
Please, stop comparing everyone you don't like to Adolf Hitler.
@ceephax: put my card in a cashpoint earlier and a windows xp found new hardware wizard popped up.
Okay, I've reached an opinion on this big debate. I think America should make mass shootings against the law.
Everybody hates on hot dogs until they smell hot dogs.
Imagine if it were possible to bottle up all the energy we spend arguing about politics online for an entire year and use it to go vote.
Chances are that somewhere in the world right now, someone is frantically attempting to teleprompt karaoke in real time.

@joquji5n324il Okay fine. I'll put the 50lb weight on my neck and you let me kick you in the head and we'll compare hospital bills. :P
@joquji5n324il But it's completely irrelevant because you cannot estimate force with kinematics.
@joquji5n324il The last time I had a kick pressure tested, it was just shy of 900PSI. Are you suggesting my shin weighs 900lbs?
@joquji5n324il @jcs Striking physics is collision, not the weight of the hand/foot.
@joquji5n324il @jcs Sure. And that's probably about the amount of PSI a beach ball getting whipped at your head would =.
@ceephax You also have to clean your pool. Don't forget.
@jcs 50 POUNDS of force. Can you imagine? That'd be like getting hit with a beach ball!
I got 99 problems and they're all woodland themed.
Just looked in the mirror, noted my hairstyle, and instinctively blurted "Dude, where do you think you're going with this?"
@neofob About a half mile, and then a trail going into a state park.
If you do yard work while listening to Hans Zimmer it seems REALLY IMPORTANT.

Goodbye real world. Fallout 4 has been released.
I like how the "3 strike" baseball rule somehow extends to everything from relationships to loss of employment to the justice system.
I apologize to families hurt by my disparaging, inexcusable remarks about manga in my last tweet. I am seeking help through anger management

Dream related science experiment: Hold a lighter on your jeans for a second, then smell that spot. It smells like outer space (and steak).
I had a dream that my ceiling had a crack in it that smelled like burning meat and eventually realized it was a portal to outer space.

@sesamel0l @twitch07 wow, memory lane. Was that the gig where @twitch07 set his head on fire from a counterfeit Chinese VR helmet?
Today I saw a squirrel gnawing through a piece of junk mail from a divorce lawyer.
My halloween costume is a guy who spoils his dog then gets beat up sparring then works on music then eats Thai food then goes to bed.
@ceephax Yeah, all of a sudden tea costs have gone up 300% around here as a result. Been drinking mud. :(
@ceephax The queen allows halloween now? Congrats!
I love how politicians are baffled by the lack of voting in the lower-class while holding their debates on subscription-only cable channels.
How do new churches get "business"? Do people just check out new churches based on Yelp reviews? Is it uncouth to " church hop"?
@derekTroberts Yup! Now it's illegal to mow it. :P
Did you know that today was the date time-traveled to in Back To The Furniture II?
I'm boycotting the new Star Wars movie because I had no desire to see a Star Wars movie.
Forbes' "Thought of the day" feels akin to asking a meth addict for directions.
I really didn't think Ikea could fuck up screws, so I used a bag of them sitting around. I feel so naive.
Home improvement tip: If you're wiring up and installing a new doorbell, have someone take your dog far far away until it's done.
@WolfeLienhardt I hate it as a 303 emulator, I love it as a 303-style MIDI sequencer for the Nord or MS-20!
@shallogal Conor fans have pushed him to almost 2 to 1 odds over Aldo (which is silly of course).
If you were transported to Kmart in 1974 with $100 to spend, what would you buy and bring back with you?
@JonnyBones: I'm gonna show you how great I am
Life without Comcast. Just...wow. #superfast #nodatacaps #alwayson #techs_with_actual_knowledge_of_network_mapping
@shallogal Conor's impressed me a lot, but I think Aldo has an unnatural level of skill and talent. You can't stand and trade with him.
This move has made me feel disgusting for having so much stuff. My goal is selling/giving at least 50% of it away by the end of January.
@acneilson yeah, Aldo's hips go into everything he throws. It adds up fast on his opponents.
@acneilson Yeah, 9 out of 10 times. I don't see how Conor's wide stance could survive the leg and body attacks alone.
Packing/moving injuries so far: 1 broken toe, required resetting. 1 torn meniscus on other leg. I need to get back to MMA where I'm safe.
Blackout! Shutting down the computers until next week when the studio is moved. Alphabasic servers will remain up, but support will be slow.
@SleepersDlight I'm not against gun laws, it's just not a solution to a much more complex problem that nobody wants to talk about.
@SleepersDlight I don't see this as a partisan issue at all, and frankly, that's why nothing is done to solve it.
@mediosordo In Chicago it was. It arguably still is, just not technically.
I like the cozy idea of gun control, but as someone who owned guns in the one place it was illegal in the US, the reality just isn't there.
Difference between the guns I bought in Chicago and Georgia was legality, registration, and being shown how to safely load/unload/fire them.
Banning guns isn't the solution. Nor is increasing punishment or security. People in America can't get adept mental healthcare. Period.
As a firearm owner and mental healthcare recipient, it is LITERALLY 10 times easier for me to buy a gun than speak to a psychiatrist.
If you have a "Salt Life" sticker on your car and the exterior isn't falling apart from oxidation, you're a god damn poser.
The only people in my life not yelling at me to look at the moon are the ones who are actually into astronomy.
@ceephax Key moment is 1:38 with the police man throwing oversized dice in a trash bag casino.
@ceephax Love the track. It's one of my all time favs. Laura Branigan sounds like a child character from a folk tale who got eaten by a lamb
@djabacus I thought about optimizing some newer Reaktor stuff for the library. I tend to use a lot of resources and have a 4k screen.
I wish there was a progress bar for packing, moving, and unpacking a 3 bedroom house and recording studio.
I love how @RichardDawkins is considered brilliant, unless his opinion on a specific issue differs from yours. Then he's a apparently a fool
Again, I appreciate everyone's support, but please note that I'm not selling the synths out of dire straights. I have backups synths!
@hanabi_ I like Roland's sequencers. JX-305 is my fav, but the poly limit hurts so I moved on to an FA-08. Getting into Elektron too.
@Metroid11 It's all good. Just culling the herd.
@ceephax Yeah the 606 is a little zzz. But it's super mod-able. I feel like that old nappy one would be perfect for a Burnkit.
Worry not. The 303 for sale isn't out of desperation. I promised myself I'd buy some new synths with the sale $. Sup @WeAreElektron
@JenMurray41 I bet somewhere between the actual book burners and Nazi accusers there's a half dozen sane people out there.
@JenMurray41 Read it with an open mind and share your opinion. That's how we gain knowledge.:)
I am thoroughly against Islamaphobia, but let's be real. That "clock in a briefcase" thing looks like it belongs in a Macgyver episode.
For some reason I looked at Kib/s on a file transfer and read it as "kibbles", and that was completely normal in my head for like an hour.
@joerogan There was overwhelming, irrefutable evidence supporting his case. He got 5 years for competently defending himself.
@danawhite I disagree. You have influence over where fights take place and which commission gets your money.
@joerogan: NSAC suspending Nick Diaz for 5 years for pot is an irresponsible abuse of power. It's callous, idiotic and sickening.
@Staiain Yeah. Although this house is in Georgia, so said fireplace will only be useful for about 10 days a year. :)
Do I build my new studio in a large living room with fireplace and bathroom, or smaller basement with picture window view of forest? Halp.
The Nevada State Athletic Commission needs to be disbanded. I can't believe the sad excuse for a hearing I just sat through.
Update. Walgreens didn't actually have my prescription ready.
Experiencing a troubling amount of notifications, emails, phone calls, and SMS messages from @Walgreens to let me know my RX is ready.
@303 To be fair it fell under my desk and I didn't care enough to fish it out and I forgot about it for a year.
If you were ever thinking about buying a Leap Motion, I just threw mine in the garbage rather than packing it in a box. That's my review.
I was wondering why everyone all of a sudden had a PhD in civil engineering, physics, and thermal analysis, and then looked at a calendar.
Does anyone know if Reaktor 6 upgrade can install alongside Reaktor 5? I don't want to waste CPU real estate for my previously made stuff.
@therumbler Thanks. I want to play my bingo. If they say "sophisticated", I win!
The Apple event stream doesn't support Chrome. Off to a great start boys.
I had dreams about generating variables in Excel sheets.
I'm scared of any event with "con" at the end of the name.
@TehTechnoGuy Unreleased would be about the same.
If you listened to all of my released music in one sitting, it would take you 30 hours, 52 minutes, and 23 seconds. You'd also be depressed.
Kanye called music awards pointless and said children should believe in themselves. Time to block your white friends on Facebook for a week.
I also will be close enough to hike to @RichardDevine 's house in the middle of a stormy night and stare in his window with a alien mask on
Negotiations and deposit down. I'm officially moving my home and studio to a house on a rocky cliff that borders a state park in October.
When Hulk Hogan would brag about his 24" pythons, and I always thought he was talking about his penis and wondered why he was using plurals.
Had to send our kitty, Lefty, to the great seafood shack in the sky tonight. He died young, but he took many birds and cicadas with him. :(
@michaudstudios There is: software piracy. Being legit means I have to lose a week of work to release and renew licenses.
After 5 full days of installing/registering software and banks on a newly built studio machine, I have successfully loaded an old session.
Compton is an excellent album, but the mastering makes me wish I was deaf after 5 minutes of listening on my monitors. :(
"Judging people based on their belief system, opinions, or culture is horrible, unless I'm doing it."-The Internet, 2015
When I tested out Xbox/PC network game streaming I swear I heard my Mac and PS4 weeping from the other room.
I'm amazed by how seamless my Windows 10 upgrades have been. It's like I'm using the exact machines but with a vastly improved interface.
Come for the score, stay for the best planetarium in the world. @twenty20k @AdlerPlanet
I HAVE BEEN SITTING IN TRAFFIC FOR 10 HOURS KILL ME
Tonight was the first time in weeks that I got a chance to catch up with the internet. Everyone is screaming about a dentist and a lion?
Things to do in Dallas on a Tuesday night for 2 road-worn travelers?
LA show felt great. Great crowd. Great vibe. Great venue. Happy ending. Thanks y'all!

@ales_kot @telefontelaviv Tix should be available at the door.
I was taking out boxes to recycle and am now deep in the trenches of a human vs. raccoon war.
I miss the days when Amazon Prime Day was about sharing time with family and friends, not a gaudy capitalistic shopping spree.
I love the ongoing cycle of 1. Kanye show announced at festival. 2. White people are outraged. 3. Kanye performance is highly acclaimed.
@toechip It works with the MIDI pickup to score speed, technique, soul, rhythm, scales, etc.
I am #2. I will be #1 if my hands must bleed. This is war.
I am not stopping this Guitar Friend Jam crap until I am #1 in the world. Mixing my competitiveness and my musicianship was not a good idea.
@floatvoidNot saying Sanders wouldn't be. It's just that congress has a way of setting limits, and Obama has hit that limit.
@floatvoid I actually don't think Obama's a scumbag. If you compare things to where they were in 2008, he's actually been very progressive.
I don't mean to be a party pooper, but Bernie Sanders would still be neutered by a congress with a 16% approval rating.
@philhartmark @jtLOL I mean, I'm being mocked for a 2015 news event relating to my 2012 tweet. So honestly it's pretty funny.
@DJPM6 @lifebythecreek That data security is a joke.
@St_Louis_Ray Really? Countries infiltrate other nation's data for political gain? Get outta here!
Yes Twitter, in 2012 I thought Mitt Romney was ridiculous for yelling about the Chinese hacking his computers in a presidential debate.
@lcf_g Was that just one pass? I didn't have the chops to expand the image pool. I'm excited for someone to make a proper GUI.
@AlanaGrelyak That? Eh. Prolly just cube lightning.
I've been in touch with Andy (from Andy's Candyland), he's doing well and WAS properly licensed. I've revised my blog accordingly.
I am not a journalist nor do I have any aspirations to be one. Telling me I'm a bad journalist over and over is kind of redundant. Eh?
@thesaucem I ran into him a few times. He seemed to just want to put the whole thing behind him.
@fucchy I offered my assistance in every way possible and ran a non-profit music center a block away. Get your facts straight.
Let's see if I can get #deepdream working before the sun comes up.
I would honestly rather my music be pirated by Chicagoans than know that they're paying a 9% "amusement tax" for listening to it.
@mrbillstunes that was just a joke referring to me not being a promotional flyer/handbill. :) but yeah, I dislike flying
@mrbillstunes yeah. My skin isn't a very good surface for gang run printing, unfortunately. :(
I fell asleep eating a bowl of honeycombs last night. 100% sober. #oldmanontour
@_wMHk I'm not sure I've ever been to a unisex spa?
@telefontelaviv I'm in. Still much nicer than the average American green room.
@telefontelaviv I glanced at this and thought these were tour dates and was wondering what kind of weird booking agent you had.
I just got kicked out of my own green room by a white dude with dreads. This venue is the ultimate exercise in patience.
Chicago show WILL definitely sell out, so get here early!
Gay goths have a really tough decision to make regarding their Facebook profile pictures today.
I drive from KC to Chicago and BAM, same-sex marriage is universally legalized. I'm going to make the trip again to end the war on drugs.
Why did I think that I'd not need a jacket in Chicago in the middle of summer?
A link to your Soundclound is not an audiobook recommendation.
Driving over 30 hours alone in the next week. Any audiobook recommendations?
@MJMSessions No idea. I'm just glad it's sorted out.
Cobra Lounge has sorted it out. Gig is back on. All is normal. I'm going to go cry in the bath tub.
I wish there were more resources for people obsessed with mushrooms for reasons other than eating them.
How* No matter how big of a phone I have, my fingers will always be too fat to type on it properly.
@TehTechnoGuy Not for a while. It's unlikely I'll have any more gigs in 2015 after LA.
Kansas City and Chicago next week! My first gigs in almost a year. I wonder if I still know hot to socialize.
@MveNevi He took my released music and sold it as library beats without permission, and got sued. Now he's apparently vanished.
A lot of people are really excited about Crystal Pepsi coming back who are far too young to remember how terrible it tasted.
How long will it take before I stop instinctively thinking of American Beauty every single time I hear someone's iPhone ring?
My nearest neighbor, who is terribly rude and has 4 vicious dogs that live outside and bark incessantly, moved out today. :):):):)
I just customized and paid for a new ronroco from an Argentinian luthier over the phone in Spanish. 50/50 awesome/fuck up odds. :-
Just rollin through SE Atlanta with my windows down and my system blaring the Blade Runner motion picture score.
@thesaucem Yeah. I want the person responsible for the things I ingest to have no incentive to cook my food properly.
People being outraged that McDonald's employees might get paid more to serve them food is really, really weird.
@TaddeoTetrapak I gots more Soundcloud accounts than I do underwear.
@Warlord_Ralts I had no idea what findom was. I'm like an 11 year old who just got a computer when it comes to that stuff.
So basically, if the world was a grain of sand, and musicians were atoms, I'd be in the top .000000000000000000001%, according to SongKick.
According to Songkick, I'm the 8125th most popular musician in the world. Time to pop open the champagne.
@TehTechnoGuy Email mark@alphabasic.com and we'll send you a free birthday copy so you can spend that money on a burger.
Annually ripping my house apart looking for the awesome place where I put my passport so I definitely wouldn't forget where I put it.
If you've spent any considerable amount of time competing in combat sports, doctors are annoyingly fascinated when examining you.
Someone commented "This sounds like The Flashbulb" on one of my secret Soundcloud accounts. Busted.
George Zimmerman is the Larry David of gun violence.
@nikoriana Some great shots in there! And usually I think all pictures of me are horrible, so that's a big compliment. :)
@nikoriana I'm trying to figure out what year this is based on the gear. Haha.
@C4ND1M4N I've been fitting and prototyping old large format anamorphic lenses to my DSLR. (Aka how the blur in Blade Runner looks)
Nothing is more American than a giant box with a box inside with a box inside containing an indestructible polyethylene rack case.
I just opened my front door and a hummingbird was staring at me floating 6 inches in front of my face. It was terrifying.
That last tweet wasn't meant to be mean. It's an actual brain disconnect, too rigid. I honestly wish I could make quality EDM! I'm too ADD.
I like how feminist writers are just now figuring out that Mayweather is a terrible person. He gets boo'd for a reason, y'all.
@mtarlton3: #MayweatherPacquiao defeated by @comcast in first round.
@SteveKopack: My count of cable companies currently fielding PPV issue tweets:nVerizonnCoxnCharternComcastnCablevisionnDirecTVnDISHnBrig
The fact that you can't legally watch this fight on anything but a cable television is ironic for a sport that began dying 10 years ago.
@MusicMan02wi Nah. It's just to [hopefully] trap carpenter bees.
@anamorphot @mauryjacks I can't believe they won't tell you this when it's their faulty product. Not everyone has weeks to wait for a screw.
I just realized I needed an external hard drive for a new laptop and used Prime Now. 20 minutes later, I'm handed a hard drive. 2015, eh?
@psychilles I was waiting at some train tracks. ;)
@b0thsidesn0w people tell me I always looked like that.
@Daveed84 He's probably made a few grand, which is about what it'll cost to sue him. Which is fine, I'd rather my attorney have the $.
@TINYPEEPEE I really did kind of want to do the Starbucks race thing, particularly in a rich, white suburb. "So how bout them blacks? eh?"
Today the cashier at Walgreen's kept bugging me to buy a clown nose and wear it for charity. See? That's why I don't leave my house.
@JonnyBones @MuscleTech Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't creatine on the WADA banned substance list?
I'm hoping NI's STEM format takes off so producers will stop mastering their tracks by mashing them through 350 back to back compressors.
@antonpylaev: @bennjordan your new albom is very beautiful!!! Have you notes of music?
I'm confused why no QHD+ 17" or larger laptops exist. Isn't larger screens kind of the point of 2k/4k resolution?
@acid_rain I've been using them since 2007. The problem is if you switch, your charts/playlists/etc resets which = lost $$$
Do gangbangers hold the remote sideways when switching TV channels?
@MusicMan02wi Tunecore? You mean the people transcoding wav files in iTunes because files ripped at 1x in EAC is inferior to them? No way!
Nothing is more frustrating than knowing how to do someone's job better than them, but they keep contradicting you because it's their job.
@ProfessorKliq @TuneCore won't even respond to remove it from their database.
@ProfessorKliq @TuneCore @DistroKid I've just lived by "If it works, don't fix it." It doesn't work now and it's costing me thousands.
.@TuneCore I pay WAY more than your competitors charge because I've been with you for 7 years and this stuff is a BIG DEAL. This is absurd.
.@TuneCore, you seriously have to get it together with my last album. It's been 6 weeks and your support can't help me or even remove it.
@katie02160 #GamerGate, people dumping ice on themselves to avoid giving to charity,@RichardDawkins fighting with mad teenage feminists.
I would like to thank judo for making it possible for me to fall forward down an entire flight of stairs and not require an ambulance.
@jen_prokop I heard. We had a pretty decent one today down here!
@telefontelaviv @DJsComplaining KHHR &gt; LAX plz.
Rather than emailing venues, I'll type out messages in text files, then close without saving. Same result without using bandwidth.
Album leaked. Orders shipping today, digital releases tomorrow. If you order the CD before midnight you'll get a free Bandcamp DL code.
@TGhirardelli Bandcamp is by far the most artist friendly. :)
@TGhirardelli Unless you're one of wealthy individuals who own Tidal, you actually have more middlemen than you would with any other service
2 Jehovah's Witnesses and a Comcast salesperson came to my door at the same time. I wish this was the setup to a joke but it happened today.
@SavannahTurk Twitter PM's aren't working. I'll email em' or something.
I just put a Halls black cherry cough drop in my mouth. I hope someone lost their job over that idea.
@kaminista @Mystyrion @SavannahTurk my fingers are crossed too. I've never had luck getting booked in SLC! :/
@SavannahTurk What's a good venue to play in SLC?
Theory: Ted Cruz has brain damage from the big bag of money the Koch brothers dropped on his head.
FedEx. 3 hour drive. 16 day delivery. Guaranteed.
@TehTechnoGuy Haha. Oh man. I nearly forgot about that. So many botches in Chicago that it's hard to keep track.
To those asking me, pre-orders should be open next week. We're waiting on 150lbs of t-shirts floating around in Fed Ex limbo.
@TheLilDoe @Deer_ebooks Still haven't pressed it. I'm scared a football will fly through my window and hit me in the head.
@derekTroberts I usually go straight for the instrument + env filter + tape machine + reverb/delay. Machines can't give me the feels.
If you ever want to discourage your kids from being an electronic musician, have them sit here while I spend 7 straight hours making a pad.
@darleysam One could argue that blocking threats on Twitter would actually be less safe if one had any legitimacy. (Musicians get them too)
This Block Bot is a rabbit hole into an unprecedented delusion. Excited to see the users try to go through life with nobody to argue with.
Hah. @MasonDAutistic @bleckwall The best way to become a wiser person is to make a blocklist for everyone who has a different opinion.
Question of the day: Why is @RichardDawkins arguing with people on Twitter about Gamergate?
@TheNotoriousMMA How classy of you to say that in a different era you'd enslave/kill black Brazilians in front of an audience in Brazil.
@acid_rain Do you know if they do their own extracts?
You idiots can't stop my service but send me bills in a state you don't offer service to. I'm not even mad, it's amazing. @integrys @ComEd
@bobknarwhal How do you conduct your podcasts with others....Skype? Phone? Google?
@DirectOfficial My last iLok broke and it took 2 months and $50 to sort it out because I didn't buy "insurance". I dl'd a torrent, solved.
@IraGame It looks like an interesting game! I hope it gets greenlit. :)
There's a staggering amount of software that I didn't buy until it was cracked so I could avoid having 50 dongles and an outside connection.
Hey @EastWestSounds I just pulled out of spending a few G's when confronted with the iLok, separate license/data stuff. It's punishing!
@IraGame Lots of learning. I'm learning how to perfect collision with things I import from C4D. I love the shaders too.
I love how disappointed strangers are when they ask me if my smart watch is the Apple watch. They feel deceived.
@MusicMan02wi They'll be on Alphabasic towards the end of the month. I'm waiting until everything is accounted for at the shipping center.
The constant purchase of lawn care products, coffee, guitar stuff, and gaming controllers made Amazon put me on their Father's Day list.
I think I'm the only hang drum owner who isn't a white guy with dreadlocks.
I can't hear the difference between "amazing bagpipe player" videos and the "bagpipe fail" videos.
Hard drive crashes are so cute a year after you've upgraded all your storage to RAID 1.
@HipNihilist Thank you. They definitely didn't obtain or even request a license for that.
@HipNihilist Which video? I definitely didn't license anything to them. Hah.
Ok, from the horse's mouth. The Flashbulb - Compositions For Piano, CD + digital, April 6th. New snazzy shirts coming soon too.
@derekTroberts Yup. Prepared means I put a bunch of shit in the strings.
@thomasmillertm CDs in production and will likely include BC code. No idea why Bandcamp announced this for me. I had a nice thing planned!
Infoleaks. Sorry, I didn't know Bandcamp sent out emails. Physical copies are in production. Normal release, no uber-limited nonsense. :)
@__lcfg Thanks, yeah I noticed it. It's been a push and pull. Every time I hammer out a UI bug for Chrome, something goes wrong on iOS, etc.
Sometime this next week I'm going to spend the day on my deck with a laptop with the goal of making a simple game with Unreal Engine.
@BT I love this stuff because Beatport refused to include me in their library years ago. Just a good thumbs up.
@GameTeeUK I checked my inbox, apparently not. What's up?
I'm going to say it, @RondaRousey is the best fighter alive today.
@Machine_Drum They torture people there by subjecting them to a text to speech voice reading out loud Tweets relating to the dress.
Shut up about the dress and calibrate your monitor.
I was wrong about @TomWheelerFCC last year. He did the right thing, and then some. We'll look back at this era as the "internet dark ages".
@derekTroberts @comcast Get back to ATL. Google Fiber is coming next year.
@BradZerivitz Give mark@alphabasic.com an email. I'll tell him to keep a head's up.
Atlanta, RELAX. Sleet/snow is not made of sarin.
@BradZerivitz Yup. Not full time or anything, but I still do a few gigs a month.
Chicago friends. The results of tomorrow's election will have an enormous impact on your life. The polls are close. Please vote!
I realize my piano notation is the equivalent to an instruction manual you get with an electronic device you order from China. Bare with me.
@Roland_US @BT @guitarcenter I love how that clip somehow got twisted into an endorsement. #BThanginAtGC #TR-8MakesTrapEasy
I hate it when people tell me about their dreams, but it's still much better than the"Where were you when 9/11 happened?" conversation.
@JoshuaDav Will do. I'm a big fan of Gearbox as well. Thanks!
@JoshuaDav Yup. I'd love to. I've sniffed around a bit, as have agencies I work with. It's such a hard industry to get into though.
@CHSommers @Raina_Punjabi @Nero You should make copies out of flash paper to starve them of any satisfaction.
@TehTechnoGuy Not that not-so-distant. :) Flowers will bloom in the northern hemisphere before anything goes for sale.
It only took a few hours to be accused of plagiarizing @AphexTwin for uploading an unreleased track I made last year to Soundcloud.
@joelcorelitz Thank you sir! Glad you enjoyed it.
I'd love to see the mass outrage 50 Shades Of Grey would create if it was written by a man.
It's 2015. No more excuses. Every first world toilet should have a bidet by now.
Bedroom musicians are finally allowed in the Grammys!
This impromptu #IDARB tournament is getting belligerent.
I'm programming a Kawai R-100 that smells like fireworks for some reason.
Today is the holiday where everyone either shouts team names or says sarcastic #lolsports stuff. No gray areas allowed.
It's an honor to see @SpiderAnderson and @nickdiaz209fight again. My heart is pounding. &lt;3
I have no problem with looking however you want to look. But if you put a corset on that "Victorian Era" model, she'd literally suffocate.
@christianburns_ Ah ok. I spent the afternoon shining a laser pointer at planes. It's my super illegal way of waving at you.
@christianburns_ Aye, if you're in ATL we should get some food or play in the studio!. :)
When a person falls into the culture of alternative medicine, GMO hatred, and conspiracy theories, I like to say that they've "biodegraded"
@VololoHeinonen Nah. The one rule dudebros SHOULD know is not to interrupt someone when they're holding 100lbs above their face.
When I see some idiot hitting on a girl when she's trying to work out at the gym, I immediately turn into a women's rights extremist.
I think I'm far more scared of Windows updates destroying my computer than I am of malware.
When I write classical piano on paper I still talk to myself like a rapper writing a beat on a stolen MPC. "I-vi-ii-V turnaround bitch, sup"
Is 32x36 THAT uncommon of a jeans size to where 3 different stores do not carry 1 pair? Argh.
I'm always confused by negative Steam reviews where the person played the game for 300 hours.
Today I finally gave into the fact that being a 6'3 tall dude who drives around the country with tons of gear justifies buying an SUV.
@NoahNagel Maybe. I was thinking about something unique, like Stone Mountain or even in the woods on my property.
Every time I sit down to write a fugue I am reminded that writing fugues in the 21st century is stupid.
Playing Master Of Puppets flawlessly after not hearing it for a decade is only cool when the girl sitting there is familiar with the song.
I built my dog a fence for xmas so she can stand out there and bark at nothing. It was also quite warm out, which is still surreal to me.
Oh wow. Turns out The Interview WILL be playing in theaters after all. What a surprise. No suspicious bullshit marketing going on here. Nope
You know it's Christmas season when you're chasing a raccoon family reunion off your deck with a pellet gun in your underwear at 4:30am.
Do ghosts superficially judge each other based on their opacity levels?
Free speech giving way to threats is horrid. That being said, stop pretending that you were excited to see another wacky Seth Rogan film.
Nothing like hiking with 35lbs of camera gear on your back while all of your memory cards sit on your computer desk at home.
Time to play the "Which one my Chrome tabs is talking?" game.
My gmail has been spamhacked, sorry if you've gotten emails. Looking for the culprit, and my jail broken iPad is the #1 suspect.
Reminder: DIY projects repurposing things you don't have a use for are stupid if you actually have to buy the junk you intend to repurpose.
Seriously. Just cancel all future MMA events until they clean up the judges. This is humiliating.
@RichardDevine Do those guys "go to the park" over and over, or is that only the My Little Pony ones?
@Troglobyne @Machine_Drum It never bothered me because I'm a selfish crank. But a lot of artists make music intended to make others happy.
@Troglobyne @Machine_Drum The culture of that community may have changed, but last I looked any mention of me kicked off derogatory nonsense
Shooting sniper rifles in real life is actually quite mentally and physically traumatic.
@acid_rain I've been looking for a more portable solution for a while, but nothing grabs me. Sick of hiking 5 miles with a 7ft metal beam!
@Troglobyne @Machine_Drum But there's a big difference between criticizing someone and saying derogatory things just to try and hurt them.
@Machine_Drum @Troglobyne Everyone needs to be able to deal with criticism. Of course.
@kimberlyeart I'm going to text you stupid pictures of my dog daily until you say "No Longer Depressed". You will submit.
@derekTroberts Might as well go digital and save a tree (I heard you've been crafting maple wood CDs)
Nothing says professional like an ear piercing goat sound when you get an error in @abobe Media Encoder.
I was recently talking about how good the Far Cry 4 score is, and how it elegantly borrows from the style of Cliff Martinez. Oh, Duh.
Regarding Scott Stapp's video, I know nothing about him, but I was in a nearly identical situation with the IRS in 2006 for 6-7 months.
I get this sick joy out of reading supporter's outraged comments on Kickstarter projects that still haven't delivered a year after their ETA
Reddit these past few days feels like going to a weird house party where a bunch of bro's are drunkenly feeding off of each other's racism.
@TehTechnoGuy Not insinuating that I have a super elite gaming keyboard. I just sadly don't have time to dive into a game. :(
@TehTechnoGuy I have 3 (for each PC down here). Seems sturdy, the lights are nice, and I use the macro keys a lot. I don't game with em tho
@Neurotrap Yeah, no dice. I was thinking about Chargeback My Debit Card And Go To Fucking Best Buy mode.
@RabblerouserGT I agree with you, as long as we recognize that one of those sides is 21 times more likely to be killed by a police officer.
White people sure seem to hate news media when it encourages a discussion about socioeconomic issues they'll never have to live with.
Idea: Instead of spending millions in tax dollars to prepare an army to control an outraged community, hire an actual fucking prosecutor.
So in a nutshell: "We changed the rules a bit in the prosecution - Darren Wilson won't be charged - Don't be mad, black people. Stay calm."
@klappstulle Ah. Check out the Arduinome. It's a bit easier to manage (mine runs patches from the Galileo board, where Monome is Max/MSP).
@klappstulle What would you be using it for? I made mine with some specific uses in mind (Kontakt and ability to control outboard synths).
@toechip @ceephax @spf420 If you book us, we will come.
@DirectOfficial It's always different. I use the piano roll enough to where I don't have to have the volume on to write, so I'm super comfy.
@anthonyelstob Or listen to Seven Eves backwards. It's the same melody.
@_SmithCommaJohn BJJ, 12 years. MMA, on and off for about 10 years. Muay Thai (which is my main thing now), 4 years in a serious camp.
@nikoriana "Alright kids, let's begin. Everything's botched, and everything's fucked. That's as much as we've figured out. Go back to bed."
@ceephax I picked one up along with the TR-3. I love the bizarre timing they have when you crank the swing.
So many musicians that don't have a lot of listeners are puzzled and outraged that Spotify isn't sending them a daily briefcase of cash.
I'm way too giddy about wearing shorts and sweating outside in mid-November.
@SenTedCruz apparently doesn't like capitalism, but likes the communist style of business where everyone is forced to have the same service.
Seriously. Take 5 minutes out of your day to write your local representative and tell them to fire @TomWheelerFCC .
The President supports Net Neutrality. The public and tech companies support Net Neutrality. Why is Tom Wheeler fucking employed right now?
I'm 100% in support of people doing whatever they want with their bodies or lifestyles. I'm not in support of ignoring basic medical science
I just had a dream that I was trying to order McDonalds but the drive thru speaker was broken and everyone behind me was honking. #nightmare
@kieranbullen Yeah, my desktops are in a sound enclosure away from any musicy stuff. That is epic looking though, haha.
Question: Is there any reason why one should NOT have a studio/gaming computer in a server rack case? I want to eliminate these desktops.
I brought Lucy to a toy dog meetup today, realized she is as socially aloof as I am.
It was 62 and cloudy here today and trick or treating was pretty much canceled as a result. So cute.
FYI the MIDI kibble is real. (WAS real, she ended up eating it)
@btfcollins hyderabadi chicken biryani, veggie samosa, and sour lassi.
Just because I'm stupid looking and dining alone doesn't mean I was stood up, but thanks for your concern, group of drunk middle-aged women.
Great job on all 200ms of your pre-order launch today @googlenexus. I was heading towards fanboy status but dodged a bullet.
I put a speed bag in the corner of my studio and I'm pretty sure I'll never wear a shirt or pants in here again.
@FamousBirthdays: @bennjordan Happy Birthday from @FamousBirthdays. Have an amazing day!
@CubSwanson @ufc THANK YOU. You not being next in line would have been the biggest injustice in the sport. Go get em, champ.
I'm not having too much trouble transitioning to this whole "83f in lateOctober" thing.
I need a new passport and SS card to renew my drivers license. I need a new drivers license and passport to get a new SS card. Here we go..
@reimer_kettel It's time to abort your whole freaking species!
The new $2,500 iMac has the same system specs as a 3 year old "internet and photoshop" computer in my studio that I'm due to replace.
My "checking out" Project Spark is turning into a massive, abstract, melancholic, side-scrolling platformer game.
@acid_rain Also with something this tempo and style I'd let the notes ride out longer a few times with vibrato fading in.
@acid_rain You seem to have the melody down. Maybe make the lead stand out more with volume, automation, and more body (double up osc)
Cockroaches in Chicago, 1cm, pack your things, burn the building down. Cockroach in Georgia, 3 inches, poor guy got lost and; wandered inside.
I want to do a @boilerroomtv set from the woods behind my house with only my dog and a few owls in the audience.
I'm off computers for a bit, thanks to the FA-06 sequencer. The onboard patches are rubbish, but Roland always seems to win with workflow.
@nickdiaz209: I'm so disappointed in Michael phelps
If I find out that hell is an Ikea without an exit, I will spend the rest of my life making Christian music.
@acid_rain I feel like I'm living in a forest cabin surrounded by really nice people. But the cabin is huge and has all my gear in it.
The combination of too much Chemex-made bold coffee on an empty stomach and Home Depot is indistinguishable from taking LSD.
@mooximus Why not rally around gender equality? That would leave the door wide open for men who are outside of the feminist demographic.
Before I get burned at the stake here, I'm just saying that labeling people by belief usually results in prejudice and polarized thinking.
@Fraxtil Sure. But me hiring a female over a male doesn't make me a feminist. It makes me someone who doesn't swallow gender stereotypes.
Emma Watson's speech was on point, but might I suggest we scrap the word "feminism" if the goal is complete gender equality?
. @comcast They're not even mine, I was just being nice.
Hey @comcast, I have 6 of your DVRs and a bunch of modems sitting in my building. You tried to charge me $40 to give them back to you. lol
Yo ISIS, that war technology currently tearing you a new one wasn't developed by praying and rejecting science and new ideas. Just FYI.
Thank you @tweetsauce for making packing my entire home and studio less excruciating and more educational.
I don't understand people who train in plastics. Like, not cutting weight, just wearing them for the hell of it. It's masochistic.
@RichardDevine Is that a pit of hot tar at the bottom?
Why do I assume that I could beat up anyone who owns a Range Rover?
Whenever I bring a garbage bag to my alley, it is ransacked and dumped everywhere. I'm just throwing shit out the window from now on.
I used to cringe at flyers for local electronic music shows until I started paying attention to flyers for local MMA events.
If barks hit mice like a punch in the stomach my dog would be doing such a fantastic job around here.
I was cranky about this Chicago coldfront until I realized that it is perfect bonfire weather.
@ceephax I'll bet you a dog bark that your houndkite patch channel is misleading and possibly torrid.
This free week of XM radio has reminded me why I don't subscribe to XM radio.
This U2 thing is inspiring. Maybe when I'm elderly I'll release a free album that you can obtain by applying for a Best Buy credit card.
@acid_rain Then once you've found the sweet spot for your drums/room, write everything down or never move the setup again. :)
@acid_rain Spend a full day mic'ing your drums. Switch up mics and preamps, try different compressors for each one, experiment, experiment.
@acid_rain @MJMSessions My god, it worked! Amazing. Thank you so much. I've seriously been scouring Google Groups for months with no result.
@acid_rain @MJMSessions I've disabled everything, reinstalled java/flash. The problem seems to usually stem from javascript buttons.
@MJMSessions @acid_rain Chrome only, and only on one machine. Persists with extensions disabled.
Out my window I hear, in the far off distance, someone crying in the famous siren-esque style of the late Lucille Ball.
Judo class is like being in a car accident that lasts 2 and a half hours.
@BT @google When I was their age I was throwing rocks at trains every day.
I am recognized by many powerful people because of my stupid eyebrow.
Am I the only one who feels that "being recognized" by someone in the professional sense is super condescending?
...while Apple awkwardly tip toes out of the room whistling.
Prepare for a week of bloggers, feminists, conservatives, and redditors immodestly arguing over the ethics of nude celebrity pictures.
If you put a thimble-full of pink paint in your mouth and sneezed on a map, you would have a good representation of T-Mobile's coverage.
I love witnessing the "life hack" of someone barreling the wrong way down a one way street in reverse.
Protip -You'll likely hear preview streams of Aphex Twin - Syro on Amazon MP3 since they typically do this despite label's request otherwise
@ceephax Damn it! K+N+1! You lucky son of a bitch. Let's do 2 out of 3!
@RADI0RaRa More importantly, even if it would be effective I'd rather focus my energy on my new home/studio/city than deal with litigation.
@RADI0RaRa Sorry if that came off as snarky, it wasn't meant to be. I'm just saying that it's extremely rare that people get justice here.
@RADI0RaRa It's Chicago. You'd be on trial with a corrupt judge deciding the outcome. I'm moving in a few weeks, problem solved.
I'm always amazed by the amount of fighters who thank Jesus for giving them power to punch someone in the head until they're unconscious.
I need to hire a hypnotherapist to make me enjoy packing.
@acid_rain Yep. Many times. They also distributed the "Inventor" guy who was just releasing my tracks as his own and ignored the DMCA's.
@acid_rain @orchtweets They were, but I DMCA'd most of the services and reclaimed. But @orchtweetsstill insists they own the publishing
@lfnt6, @reimer_kettel now releases music as Nasko Mentata, that's why his Kettel project hasn't had a release lately.
It's beyond a civil case. It's legitimate fraud. IODA has never owned, leased, or had anything to do with my music. @orchtweets
@frenchbloke I have no idea if it is SYRO, what I've heard sounds like Skrillex, but not cheesy and far more dark, technical, and bipolar.
@frenchbloke The most recent RDJ I heard is very "large" and abrasive sounding and I can't wrap my head around it's production.
@frenchbloke Kind of sounds like if a Roland Fantom had "drill and bass" preset songs.
You can't have a great show without a great audience. It's teamwork. Thanks NYC!
@terreessaa sorry I take such awkward pictures with people. I need to learn to do the smile and thumbs up thing.
The service in my Brooklyn hotel is so terrible that it's actually entertaining. Like a movie that is so bad that it becomes a cult classic.
Every time a new tablet is announced I get really excited and then realize that I have literally no use for a tablet.
@acid_rain Enable the WQHD (2560x1440) for a proper price/product comparison.
People proclaiming their hatred for Facebook on their completely voluntary Facebook accounts is at an all time high.
If software claims to "revolutionize the way you....", it means you'll have to create an account and add 15 steps to what you did before.
Well that good feeling only took about 10 minutes of running errands to be completely devoured by botch.
I love it when inspiration randomly smacks you in the face. It's like being shot with an adderall dart.
Someone needs to make a site where you can search through identity theft scams, but unwanted users post legit real estate listings there.
Does a dog treat exist where a reviewer doesn't claim that it killed their dog?
One cloned MAC address and we're up and runnin' boys.
My hood's internet is down and Comcast is refusing to reauthorize my account unless I start leasing their modem instead of using my own.
Today my goal is to eat wild huckleberries on a glacier and not be destroyed by the many grizzly bears with the same goal.
"Thanks for coming out. Yeah, the hotel is great. Enough room for all my guns and MMA training stuff. And 6 pit bulls."
When someone introduces themselves by stating that they heard what hotel you're staying at,how do you respond?
Man, I miss @nickdiaz209 and @NateDiaz209. Pay the men and get them back in there. I can't watch fight replays forever.
@ceephax I thought the photographer was you at first and that you had build some tiny acid interface the size of a slice of bread.
I stayed up all night carefully cleaning a terrible piece of dust on my camera sensor the day before leaving for a huge photography trip. :O
Running Win7 32bit in Vmware with legacy versions of .net and c++ libraries in order to update my brand new Garmin GPS. What a rabbit hole.
@christianburns_ Thanks! It was a pleasure meeting you. Let's make it a point to hang again!
I'm in a waiting room listening to a mulleted guy telling an elderly woman about Korn, and she's trying so hard to seem interested.
And by "sick of this shit" I mean, how many more times does this have to happen before the city actually deals with the problem.
Quote of the day: "Unless you're speaking McNuggets into my hands, I don't wanna hear it."
@bartelmusicLove this track. Anything else from this guy/girl?
@ceephax It seems way more ominous if you put the sounds through a long reverb.
I haven't completed my morning jog and I've already seen 2 unrelatef people starting their day with a cig and a Coors Light. #Bridgeport
I wish my search query for "Coolest tank top" was taken more literally.
BRB. I'm going to make a Schweinsteiger EA UFC character and give him 0 stats.
I'm going to get an ulcer before this game is over.
@sesamel0l Do you have a red one? I didn't get to see that.
I'm going to make one that says "Unless you cannot speak English, a tree died for nothing."
@anthonyelstob Nope. But it sounds like both myself and the composer were using an Alesis Andromeda. :)
Ronda Rousey fighting is like Aphex Twin albums dropping in the 90's. You don't even realize what is going on until you take it in 5 times.
New obsession: Infomercials bragging about how strong a product is by showing a video of someone desperately trying to destroy it.
@__MICHAELJ0RDAN: accidentally tried to bounce a cantaloupe that i was holding
I love my country so much that I'm going deep into the woods to avoid the constant, nerve-wracking explosions.
Do food delivery people understand the kind of power they possess by being able to derail your entire day by being half an hour late?
@nichodges Yeah. Although I don't use computers on tour. This is the plugin editor for the Korg M50.
@BT: There is a prevalence of political correctness today in everything (including parenting) that removes work ethic and increases enti
Argentina. You almost gave me a heart attack. Phew.
I just realized that from waking up until going to sleep, I'll be watching sports next Saturday. That's a first.
@jjn8 @AnnCoulter She should tell the beloved, not-discriminated against, Sioux people about this "world cup" thing they never heard of.
@199jobs I really wish I could've overheard the idiotic discussion that led to this business model of yours.
At what point is @AnnCoulter just going to Tweet topless pictures and racial slurs in all caps to try to win back relevancy.
Props to the Chicago PD for doing such a fine job at making sure nobody looks at or photographs the beautiful foggy lakefront this evening!
If you've tried to email me in the last 2 weeks and bounced, thank Google Apps for changing MX servers, then notifying me via dead address.
@_lapetitesouris My goal is to kick through a baseball bat by the end of the year. How ignorant is that?
Butter in coffee. Bacon wrapped gluten-free tacos. What the hell is wrong with you people?
@_lapetitesouris they're my favorite. All the hair on my shins is burned/rubbed off from years of them.
Those of you who are somehow angry that the NFL is no longer allowed to patent a racial slur are getting shin kicked. Hard.
@JonnyBones Make a contest where your fans paint/draw their favorite moment of you fighting. That'd be rad to look at!
It's that time of year to ask people if they know what mercury being in retrograde actually means and then listen to them try to explain it.
@CHSommers It's pretty much like a whale hunting enthusiast burning "Moby Dick" because he hates 90's electronica and penises.
My favorite thing about Xbox One is being frustrated that I had to tell my TV to turn on twice before it listened, then letting that sink in
@BT August 16th in NYC, and around that time. If you have a day off in Chi, you should come to my training camp. :)
@BT We should high five when you're in Chicago. Looks like you'll be out of town when I'm on the east coast tho!
Coldplay - Ghost Stories is jam packed full of great songwriting and production and I don't care how lame you think I am for saying that.
@CHSommers You should thank them for buying your book, and more importantly, making themselves literal examples of many of your points.
@MusicMan02wi Saturday. I think it ends before midnight.
If you're Bosnian, hurry and buy a lotto ticket before this wears off.
@Pamiiruq @BT Lots of companies don't "let" you do things. Building a hackintosh is a piece o' cake.
@BT I'm not sure if it's as easy on a Mac,but I usually just keep Linux on an external drive and let the boot order decide when I plug it in
@BT Apple and Win8 do not seem to play well together due to their entirely different implementations of UEFI. It can get icky.
I like that torrent downloads are now almost always preferable over HTTP for large files. I wonder if servers will be a thing in 20 years.
@BiIIMurray: Naps are tricky because you either wake up refreshed and relaxed or you have a headache, dry throat, and are unaware of wha
Thanks for the tips! Now, does anyone know how I can stream the World Cup in a window in FLStudio? Or perhaps a Korg Kronos?
Any pro tips on the best stream for the world cup? I have a feeling ESPN is going to be botched again. I'm a VPN'er so region is no issue.
@thomasmillertm Or just take a picture of Englewood.
@ceephax It suits you since 98% of the time you're sleeping, you loudly bleat out recitals of Ray Charles songs. #earplugs #motel6 #roman
@BT Thanks! Your stuff is inspiring as well. I actually think we very briefly met at @RichardDevine 's wedding if I remember correctly.
@BT @Pandora I tried opting out as they've paid me NO royalties for 8 year, and they claimed that fair use allows them to stream my albums
I wonder if there's a record for total financial loss due to spillied coffee. I probably just beat it. :(
@thomasmillertm @Ubisoft Te New Madrid fault line could go haywire and create some. The destruction will be unnoticeable on the south side.
I wonder if @Ubisoft has ever actually been to Chicago. Not so many mountains around here.
@joerogan: Dear everyone using "natural" deodorant, it's not working, you stinky bitch.
A cop just told me that I can't enter my own neighborhood during a Sox game unless I buy a diamond emblem for my car. Lol Guess I'm camping.
@bl00dklot Probably the audiobook for The Stand 3x because it would keep me alive for another decade.
@Mogilevski Great presentation. The music cues are a bit too traditional, but I could be biased as a space music composer. :-P
I was naive to not book a ferry in advance to an island with wild horses. Finding new excursion for the week.
@reimer_kettel My friend Matvei is having a birthday party that day. Can you push it to May 27th?
@Daveed84 Sadly, yes. Although if someone played that at my training camp, they'd have a pretty rough day.
If a Youtube video starts with a voice whispering "Let The Bodies Hit The Floor" over and over, press ALT-F4 immediately.
It sounded like an overheating robot wearing a tuxedo and top hat.
An awkward text to speech voice just called me at 1am claiming to be Chase needing to reactivate my card. I entered all 6's. It worked.
I was 80% sure thousands of people were going to get an email that said "Here's your code: //LIST(*_|DOWNLOAD_CODE|_*)". Phew!
Please keep in mind that I'm just a dude releasing my own music. Now that I successfully did a DL-code thing, I'll do better next time. =)
There are no Solar One codes because I was not PHP-savvy enough to make a mail script that complex without potentially botching the NIR ones
I kind of wish I started a #nothingisreal hash tag campaign. It would look like everyone was believing in a Matrix type scenario.
@Mystyrion I believe they are being processed and shipped between Friday and tomorrow.
Yes y'all, (depending on how adept I was at Excel this afternoon) CD orders will receive download codes via email just after midnight.
@tree_star_moon I'd love to. I just need someone in DC willing to book me.
I was just called a racist for asking some weirdo to stop loudly clanging around in my garbage at 4am. He was white.
What is it about attending a university that makes people think they are immune to oncoming traffic.
@__Acro Touring this year depends on my surgery/recovery (I have a torn labrum). So everything is on hold until that gets sorted.
@__Acro Had two 8192's a block away from each other, went to another tab to respond to a message, came back and the stupid thing reset. &gt;:(
@lfnunley I was in Aaron's gritty basement watching him work on this. :)
I'm making a "DJ mix" for a radio station and trying to blend the songs as if they were in a dream, rather than beatmatching. It's creepy.
@TehTechnoGuy Nope, they were surprisingly unscathed.
Correction: 1000's of copies of Nothing Is Real WERE the sales floor of a UPS store in Bronzeville for over 5 days.
FYI - 1000's of copies of Nothing Is Real sat on the sales floor of a UPS store in Bronzeville for over 5 days without anyone notifying me.
Why am I obsessed with playing jazz inversions of the song at the end of Slumdog Millionaire at 2am.
Converting my T3i sensor to 715nm IR is probably as nerve wracking as defusing a bomb.
@LR_Kaiveran It will remain open. I'll still be a partner.
The resolution will make both photographers and scrap yard owners happy. I will share pictures of my "meet up" with them next week.
I am pleased to say that @AcmeRefining has been very personal and understanding in resolving the issue without attorneys or red tape.
I love how my inbox is polarized by people offering support for this photo incident, and people saying they wish the guards had killed me.
The funny thing is that this project was my homage to Chicago before moving. I will never do another artistic thing here as long as I live.
And nevermind. They filed a report for criminal trespassing, and I was told that I have to take up the seizure and destruction in civil cour
I have most of it on video so luckily I think this will not side against my favor with the charges
And timelapse rig trashed, memory card of today's footage destroyed by a "security guard". At the police station facing and pressing charges
I'm actually pretty frightened that my brain is flawlessly storing VST instrument demo clips I heard once in 2006.
@Alisonsevers Brits always expect us to be obese.
@_lapetitesouris and where is this Sesame Street area that you live?
Things are about to ramp up over here. Keep your ears perked.
@danawhite Wow. It's kind of like a really expensive, Islamic, Field Of Dreams.
Parkour fail videos are amazing because it just looks like the people are trying to commit suicide really ineptly.
When I look at my Facebook friend's favorite topics on Quizup, I realize that I should definitely ride solo when the apocalypse happens.
In the same hour I was offered aninternationally televized fight and diagnosed with a shoulder tear that requires 10 months to recover. :(
I may have finally have gained the seniority to declare a "no AC/DC" policy at my training camp.
8 guitar tracks running through separate autotune andharmonization channels is exactly how to completely freeze the modern computer in 2014.
So Goat Simulator looks and plays better than DayZ Standalone. Not surprising at this point.
@mediosordo I think what is threatening, is that I very openly want to test it and then release a free open source CMS for other musicians.
But speaking of Showseed, does anyone know of any venues in Toronto that read their email?
Got a cease and desist regarding Showseed from a company who claims I stole an idea they haven't implemented or even announced yet.
@Zemnmez The diffuse reflection would come from our own atmosphere.
Electronic music genres are a bit like diamonds. Black people discover them, and a few years later white people cut, polish, and sell them.
If you looked at a planet through a telescope while someone shot a 50mW blue laser at it, you would go blind from the diffuse reflection
@realDonaldTrump It was a big step too! We'd love to see you put some pressure on your state to finally legalize MMA.
@pandora_radio I've tried emailing with no response. It won't allow me to DM you here. Can you email my license manager? mark@alphabasic.com
@SeverEric @COSMOSonTV I'm always happy to compose for @adlerskywatch, but my next release will be quite different than anything I've done.
A big problem with seeking help for an original idea is that you're opening the gates for someone to steal it.
@Kaboomin I get a free car wash for every car wash ad over 7 inches in width that I get tattoo'd to my body. Livin' the high life.
@JustLikeAmmy Early humans worked together and learned to track the migration patterns of deer, rather than killing each other over venison.
I was just thinking "Is it too late to crack open a sarsaparilla?" and then realized I have absolutely no idea what time it is.
@JustLikeAmmy If we didn't look at the world with pure reason, we wouldn't have survived long enough to feel the gift of emotion.
@JonnyBones: Why not give the winner of Alexander and DC the winner of myself and Glover??
@telefontelaviv @CapitolRecords I'll happily do the CDs/publishing and not make $1 off of it Josh.
@ComEd Exelon's superpower: Lobbying! #ComEdSuperPowers
Maybe at some point I should shave down and master some of the 60 or so sessions I've written/recorded in the last 2 years.
@moncrey "Severe shoulder impingement" A cortisone shot here and there until I'm done with MMA, then surgery if it still bugs me later.
@GorgeousFace From training. No single incident or anything.
I would've never voted for Obama had I known that he wouldn't start a global nuclear war over Russian troops in Crimea. Just sayin'.
@derekTroberts They were especially concerned for my privacy when they sold my office # and information to marketers without permission.
@derekTroberts I read it as "Comcast Rolls Out Plan To Let Benn Jordan Read Hundreds Of Customer's Facebook Messages"
Someone can rapidly fire a pistol next to your head while you're listening to Carnival Of The Animals (Swan) and you wouldn't even notice.
Today I discovered that Gmail somehow automatically archived my rejection letter from Mars One. I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
After some internet sleuthing, I'm finding that most of my longterm Ruzzle rivalries are with new mothers.
Interesting. Accuweather is actually less accurate than simply looking at your region's weather averages.
@Alisonsevers Where are you headed? Is it your virgin trip to the states?
@Alisonsevers This is unfortunately normal for most Americans.
Years ago I turned down a decent amount of money to drink Monster energy drink on stage. Why do so many people wear/stick the logo for free?
@joerogan When they started acting sketchy I pulled out, and they've held my savings in "queue for withdrawal" for months. Now this. Ugh.
Imagine how grim and weird the Daily Show would be if they only reported and joked about news exclusively from the Nuba region of Sudan.
@GorgeousFace Haha. If I were a model it'd be a good thing. I'm a commissioned fighter so being underweight can actually get me suspended.
After having the stomach flu last week, I'm officially UNDERweight for the first time since I was 16. Red meat and whey shakes all week bro.
Props to Seagate for scanning my dead hard drive and giving me a popup telling me to give them my address so they can send me a new one.
Today's Weather: Wet Ashtray In Back Of Refrigerator
@neiltyson American ones look utterly terrified.
@E1ke I know, right? I think that may be due to poverty and lack of healthcare in Detroit/Flint areas though. Which is even more depressing.
Alright. This place is a frozen dump. I'm moving later this year.
Running a bad fever feels like your brain keeps its memories and knowledge, but somehow replaces your logic with a sleepy 7 year olds
@danawhite: How many hammer fists before u let go of the single?! OUCH
@CyclingMikey @konacommuter That's not sharing the road. That's intentionally being a dick and promoting road rage.
I'm sure breakcore fans will be ecstatic to hear that I've gained avast appreciation for woodwinds and marimba.
I bet the cyclist leisurely riding in the middle of Halsted St in front of a 3 mile traffic jam he's caused brags about carbon offsetting.
@Kryptolith I think it's ridiculous when my fans buy both CD/MP3. I was just "thinking out loud". I'd kill for some free time to play VGs.
From a moral standpoint, if you bought a game for a console, then later decided you'd rather play it on PC. Would torrenting it be piracy?
@Metroid11 I'm not positive, but I believe they're no longer functioning.
@jcs I'm glad to be so associated with such fine advertising.
Wait, so George Zimmerman can fight DMX, but not a minor?
MMA license renewed at welterweight. All of my clothes are 2-3 sizes too big.
@SurpriseAdopter @emelynnnn K. Contact my booking agent and we can confirm the details and time/date!
I wonder how many mice you can mercy kill before you just entirely lose your mind.
@michethekiller Let me know when it is consistently above 60f there. I'm making a visit before this winter kills me.
Amount of people posting on my feed about the Super Bowl: 3. Amount of people posting about how they don't care about the Super Bowl: 3000.
I almost contributed to a Youtube comment argument before I realized what it would do to my self-esteem.
How about deporting the news organizations that run nonstop coverage of Beiber and let the kid fall into obscurity like all youth idols do.
Also,@pandora_radio has streamed my music since their debut and I haven't received a dime. Been emailing for years, hopefully this works.
Hey @pandora_radio, can we please finally work something out so people will stop bugging me about my botched discography on your service?
I love the idea of people following the artist they listen to while taking drugs only to get Bob Vila winter toilet hacks in their feed
An army of mice descended upon my home last night and they had no idea how prepared I was.
@danawhite I'll throw you some passes for Cosmic Wonder @ the Adler Planetarium if you want to visit deep space while you're in town. :)
@telefontelaviv I DL'd it just to see if my albums were on there, considering I've never heard of or agreed to have music on it. And yup.
@knotstheinane Those messages go to an email address I don't even remember the password for. Checkmate.
...I'm just running out of ways to entertain myself while my dog slowly geocaches and researches the spot where she is going to poop.
I apologize to the old Hispanic woman who saw me shin kicking old shovel sticks in the alley at 4am. That was probably really disturbing.
@oshinoshi 2 hands would be impossible. 3 hands if you're Japanese and under 20 years old. 4 hands is possible for everyone else.

I just applied beard wax for the first time. I'm going to go ahead and recommend it.
I've been dealing with a Henry Mancini obsession throughout most of 2014 so far.
I wonder if the plumbers I hired are going to show up 7 hours late again, or if I'll be without running water for another week.
Ok Google. Let's make a deal. I'll use Google+ if you install fiber to my neighborhood and give me some smart goggles or whatever.
@RahmEmanuel will you let me show you how to build an e-cig from scratch before trying to ban them in Chicago next week?
@joelcorelitz Games like Red Dead Redemption are 10/10 for 12 hours, then get dusty. Rise Of Nations, Minecraft, etc are 8/10 for years.
It's kind of hard to believe that the wind chill between Monday and Friday this week is an 83 difference.
Today my pipes burst and I slipped on the resulting ice and fell down a flight of stairs. I now lack running water. #Obamacare #peebottles
Mother nature is kicking my ass, but not as much as the sociopath who shot snow from his snowblower all over the areas I keep shoveling.
I wake up and shovel. I work a bit then shovel. I eat dinner and shovel. I shovel before bed. When will this end.
@acid_rain what do you mean? Like desktop wallpaper of my dopey face?
I just walked to Bark and; Bites to get Lucy some Muttluks and Woof Walkers. Am I even alive right now?
Having a garage during a blizzard is awesome, unless you live in a city where nobody bothers to plow alleys. I may need a rescue chopper.
-40F windchills on Monday. Guess I'm wearing my sauna suit on Monday.
Today is the magical day when I finally memorized my cellphone number and stop having to look it up every time I order food.
@jjn8 I can't wait to see how far the percentage of leg kicks drops in Aldo's next fight.
I feel really unmotivated about practicing leg kicks today.
@SpiderAnderson Voc carreira  inspirador, e  o oposto de decep. Espero que voc tenha uma recupera r.
Watching Silva walk out first is so weird. #UFC168
My X-Mas presents mostly went like: "I don't know what the hell Arduino is, but here ya go."
For those on the fence about switching DAWs, FL Studio is 40% off right now, and the plugin bundles are 70% off.
@acid_rain Ah yeah, I have the MVP 1. Nice little box mod. Recently picked up the VTR. It can't charge your phone, but it's sexy (and heavy)
Somehow in the convoluted reality that we live in, simply adding "Fox Sports 1" to my cable/internet plan would cost me $119 more.
We still plan on doing the podcast next Sunday! Since the AMA was on Reddit, what topics would you like us to talk about? (serious)
@adlerskywatch: Today is the #WinterSolstice which marks the 1st day of winter in the northern hemisphere and the shortest day of the ye
I thought Duck Dynasty was a cartoon. So this whole thing was really confusing to read about.
The mods at Reddit don't like my idea of recording the answers to the questions. So I'll just me doing a normal Reddit AMA this time. Sorry!
@dirkboersma I'm thinking maybe r/music would be best.
@dirkboersma I will in 6 minutes, because I forgot to fill out the title and now I'm in a 10 minute post ban prison.
Listening to the new Burial EP during training made me feel like I was sparring inside a tub of rubber cement.
Whoa wait, so if I uninstall the annoying bloatware that is Steam, I cannot play the games I bought through it? I have so much regret.
It's -10F outside, and time to have a serious talk with my dog about paw boots.
@telefontelaviv If you need an idiot around throwing botched ideas off of you, you know who to call.
I lost my voice on this tour and I sound like a hardened criminal, which is really awkward during small talk at truckstops.
I love how the world keeps reacting in shock to things Kanye says, as if anything rational will ever come out of his mouth.
From this point forward you may only take a picture with me if you are in a submission hold during the snapping of said picture.
If you don't drink but love hangovers, sit in a hot tub for a few hours and fall asleep before drinking a gallon of water.
I'm very excited for a hot tub in Kansas City tonight.
Shooting in the Salton Sea tomorrow. Been waiting many years to get out there.
I am temporarily living in a private condo 2x the size of my 3 story house. Much better than a commune.
250 mile gridlock to LA. Any tips on a good food spot or activity for a brief night in Hollywood?
Also, I think San Fran surprisingly has the best MMA camps per capita. 10th Planet and K One are absolutely next level. My face hurts.
Sold out gig in San Francisco. Unexpectedly staying in a 4x6ft room in a commune. The 2 kind of cancel each other out.
Lincoln, I don't know what toxin is in your water that makes you so hospitable and nice, but it's always a pleasure. Thx for a great night!
@lfnt6 I'll be in LA with my gear, and not performing. I try to work something out every year, but it's a lost cause. :(
Woke up early for some Judo in Nebraska / got my ass kicked by friendly and technically superior farm people.
80% of commercials in Lincoln, NE have dubstep in them.
@plinkieee If I setup my XBone today I'll have to punch myself in the face before every game for the next 5 years.
My face got busted up sparring and now my phone doesn't recognize me. What a stupid problem.
I love this devastation about Winamp getting shutdown, despite the fact it's been an unusable, buggy, pile of trash for the last 10 years.
#lifehacks Why spend money on expensive disposable razors when you have a drawer full of knives in your kitchen?
Man, if you browse the internet while listening to the Inception score, it feels way more purposeful and important.
People's Gas just came to my building, turned on a meter with an open line in one of the apartments, then said "You should cap it" and left.
2 more days until my Xbox One arrives and sits in a box for a month until I'm home from tour.
A marathon of watching Deadmou5's Youtube vids of him figuring out a modular synth would take a mere 14 min less than the time he's owned it
Jesus christ. A relentless General Hospital marathon would take 431 days.
If you were to have a nonstop, sleepless, relentless Simpsons marathon, it would take you nearly 9 days.
Today is the first time I've worried about Xmas shopping and being killed by a tornado in the same minute.
My brain "wants" to be excited about getting a new furnace, but it's really the shittiest expensive new thing you can get.
@TheGiftOfGob 6 days a week of either BJJ or boxing (or both) + 1300 calorie per day restriction + 2 gallons of water per day. Not so tough.
As of today, I have officially arrived at middleweight. A drop of 30lbs in under 100 days. Pizza, I miss you so much.
@TheGiftOfGob Last I heard Robert Trujillo has it.
@MusicMan02wi Nope, I've done that to a few guitars. My basses are stock fretless.
@bammtv I wonder if I could legally drink a glass of wine when that picture was taken. :)
@danawhite This is the face everyone seems to make in those pictures that capture the moment before a 90mph fowl ball hits them in the eye.
Be sure to follow The Walking Dead so they can spoil every single episode if you're not 1 of the 8 elderly people who watch TV as it airs.
@djscratchin That certainly sounds like drawn sound (on the film itself).
@NOAADebris: Some talk is making the rounds that there's an "island of debris" from Japan coming this way. This is myth ...there's no ev
Hey everyone. Go get a flu shot today. Thank me in January.
Once upon a time, I was recording a sad accordion tune without a belt on and my pants fell down. I think of that moment as my "rock bottom".
I just spent 40 minutes making a cup of coffee, and it is, by far, the best cup of coffee I've ever had.
If I hit one of these kids dressed as a zombie that run out in front of my car in the pouring rain I'm just going to pretend they're real.
@DiegoMessina I didn't really switch. I've probably been doing both for the same amount of years.
I awoke on my couch from a dream where the Jon Stewart theme song was sung by baying hounds, and Jon blamed it on Comedy Central's budget.
I hear live Mexican music and someone chopping things with an axe outside my window. This is going to manifest into a nightmare tonight.
I fixed my furnace myself. It now sounds like a helicopter crashing inside of a dumpster, but I fixed er.

I just searched "808 cowbell straying out of tune" actually expecting to find a solution.
I hired a starving cat to hunt down mice in my building. His name is Brian. I promise to not post more than 1 picture a month of him.
Wait. Why am I making reggae with outboard synths?
@jessamynduke Your fight that aired last night was INCREDIBLE. You guys were unstoppable. Can't wait to see more of you in the future!
I'm just not figuring out that tacos are a new hipster thing.
QuNeo, APC40, Launchpad S, LVBase 1, etc. Tell me which to buy and why. Please. Thanks!
Dear Sinead O'Connor, I think you forgot that Miley Cyrus could easily buy her record label. Love, Benn Jordan.
I finally stopped pirating Adobe products, and they've emailed me saying they were hacked with my stored debit card info. Lesson learned.
The wind blew my internet connection away. Watch my productivity soar.
Today I'll punch a Republican in the face for my botched national park camping trip I've patiently waited all year to go on this month.
Thanks to those of you who came out last night, I was happy to finally play Chicago with the full visualization setup.
Online/advance tickets are sold out, but there's still some avail at the Adler box office. Also, show up a bit early as it is a seated show!

@JonnyBones: That fight was just what I needed
Emailing venues in LA is like offering someone on the street $4,000 and them putting on sunglasses and headphones and walking off.
I want to see a "Friends Put Oculus Rift On Unconscious Drunk Guy" prank video.
@ruskoofficial Awesome. I should be in town. I'll PM you my infos. :)
@ruskoofficial Sure thing. Better yet you should visit my studio/community center while you're here. When will you be in town?
I wonder how long it took Old Spice to figure out how to make their deodorant last 2 weeks rather than the previous 6 months per stick.
If I existed in the quantum state and observed myself in a mirror, I wonder what my reflection would be doing.
I wish people would read a few pages of text before screaming about how we don't have enough money for military intervention with Syria.
I sat in traffic near some sort of metal factory that smelled like blood. It was far more unsettling than one would imagine.
American Spirits sent me a cactus in the mail today. It was dead. I wonder if they're begging or threatening me to start smoking.
I went to see a 4D movie and by the time I walked out of the theater, everyone I've ever loved had been dead for centuries.
Large US Cities I've never played in and wish I'd get booked in: Salt Lake City, Houston, Santa Fe.
I wonder how many trees I've destroyed in the processing of servicing my damaged laser printer.
I had a dream last night that a really intuitive and powerful loop pedal was shipped to me. Sadly this product only exists in that reality.
@thomasmillertm Yes I planned to, although the Leap comes up short on just about every promise. Fingers crossed for Kinect 2.
I keep reading about how difficult it is to find work in this economy, while 4 out of 5 independent contractors I hire don't even show up.
To clear up a rumor: "Let Me Walk You To Your Honda" wasn't composed for an advert or ever licensed for one. The title is just nostalgic.
@yaz36 @acid_rain I was in Detroit earlier this year and some guy backstage asked me if it was a DOPE OBOE.
The downside of ecigs is that it is a magnet for people who want you to know that they smoke dope and would somehow smoke it with said ecigs
@riglow I don't think there's a square foot in here without MIDI something in it.
If someone put a gun to your head and made you choose between a Jesus fish or a coexist sticker to put on your car, which would you choose?
@frewsxcv @bandcamp for sure. It's free (you have to pay a service to put your stuff on iTunes/etc), and they take 15% vs the usual 33%.
I have 99 problems and like 76 of them are related to Facebook in some way.
Ouch. Came home to my main music/work hard drive clicking/dying, and I haven't backed up in ages. Pray for me.
Remember those terrible false story chain emails your aunt used to constantly FWD to you? Facebook is a really expensive version of that.
If I would've flushed my phone down the toilet this morning, I would've gotten some work done.
My experience with the Leap Motion team on a simple credit card/shipping transaction has pushed me to pull out of every Kickstarter project.
When will people stop talking and bragging about bacon? It's like the "Got Pork?" campaign ended and this is their genius viral followup.
The first nice thing I've ever had to say about Comcast: I must have missed the upgrade but I'm downloading at 18MB/s right now. High five.
@joerogan I find it strange that they only allowed 2nd degree murder or innocent, and removed manslaughter/etc as a possible consideration.
Yesterday I was on a mountain falling asleep in the sun. Today I am falling asleep covered in RAM and SATA cables.
Nothing like coming home to a stack of deadlines and a USB over-current error when booting up the old studio.
@JamesBurthe For what I'm doing, muay thai/wrestling/boxing is giving much better results. Probably bc of my height and weight class.
@JamesBurthe 10th Planet in SF. Got my black from ASD in Chicago (meh). At MOTA I'm "Gracie certified" purple and am happy with it.
Have you ever put a bunch of wet concrete in a thin PVC pipe and blew it into a basement ceiling crevice? Is doing that 250 times dangerous?
@JonnyBones @CubSwanson That hip toss changed my life.
Last night accidentally I uploaded a weird video intended for one of my Youtube troll accounts to my main one. Oops.
@JamesBurthe Thanks. Do you "roll", bro? What rank are you?
Such mixed feelings about tonight. Silva is my hero, but I feel like justice was served raw for his display of ego and disrespect.
@JamesBurthe Man, the transition to nogi/mma is awful in that sense. Your own heel + cup + junk that doesn't fit 100% into cup = hospital.
The 4th is probably the worst day of the year when you live among inbred gangbangers who somehow have access to military grade explosives.
"Yay hockey! Get the guns and 5,000 rounds of ammo. It's time to celebrate in this densely populated area." - Everyone in South Chicago.
@Machine_Drum Really? Lurking WATMM now is like seeing your gradeschool bully calling you a pussy through his McDonalds drive-thru headset.
I just realized that I've funded about 10 successful Kickstarter projects, and 0% of them have resulted in me receiving the product so far.
World War Z premiere. Hot zombie date with @twitch07. The theater served me a gallon of beer.
"Corn Nuts: The only snack with big enough kernels to step into the octagon."I didn't make that slogan up btw.
@ItsKrystleG Often combined with wearing tights as pants. Ick.

They should make one end of the Mac Pro cylinder-thing pointy to symbolize the nail in the coffin the product's legitimacy.
"Want to go to the park, Lucy?" is now "Want to search for trash to lick while I play the new Animal Crossing?"
I was just using a sophisticated laser level when putting up shelves only to abandon its logic to aesthetically fit my off-level home.
Moving is like coming back from a vacation that was so shitty and laborious that nothing seems the same anymore.
The coolest feature of a Galaxy Nexus is its slow, colorful, and incredibly psychedelic death after you crack the screen.
I've had a broken middle toe from BJJ for a week and just now went to the doctor. Blurring the line between tough and retarded.
@bartelmusic Can I print this out and hang it in the empty booth across from me at Pegasus Taverna?
@joerogan Can you explain these bird sounds I'm hearing in UFC 160?
@HouseBreaker1 @RoryChandlerYup. I'm an idiot. :)
@rukasound You are aware that Hungarian farms still buy non-GMO products from Monsanto, right? They even have a major headquarters there.
My reaction to the Xbox One reveal: tv eh?, meh, cloud bleh, EA meh, JON JONES! whoa!!!!, meh, watercooler lol, CoD bleh, how much?, oh.meh
I just had to stop myself while yelling at my Roomba. Does that bring us closer to singularity?
@MoreSpins @GreenHitz I just signed your number up with the church of Scientology. Maybe they can help your annoying spamming habits.
I heavily trained for over 3 hours today without getting tired. I'm not sure what caused this anomaly, but I wish it was the norm.
@ItsKrystleG I was just in Texas and saw Whataburgers about every 50ft. I was apprehensive. Are they actually tasty?
I need to update my rider with a clause so when people have my logo tattooed on them, they get free admission to shows. At the very least!
All this puzzle solving and decryption is going to be so hilarious if the new BOC album turns out to suck.
@bridgetdriessen I found someone who literally moved to New York over 10 years ago.
@PlatinumVoicePR if directed Twitter spam is your idea of PR, you'll probably do better selling penis enlargement pills.
@MusicMan02wi Trying to work something out with them. Perhaps just a few key tracks.
@EthanMyers I don't mind it with the banana. It's the BSN supplements that make me cringe.

@joerogan Next time you're in Chicago, DMT adventure. K?
@thesaucem I haven't drank since....2012? I don't even remember.
@acid_rain It's going to take a lot more than that to get me to use a laptop live again. :)
@JonnyBones I think I've recently stayed in that same room/floor and took almost the same pic. The showers in there are excellent.
Fl Studio 11 supports in-session Ruby coding. Guess I'm not going to get out this summer after all.
Umbrella thieves: watch the movie Taken as if it were a horoscope.
If you leave your umbrella by the door, anyone who walks by that door when it's raining becomes a Marxist. And by Marxist I mean thief. &gt;:O
@WorksCouture In my neighborhood (Bridgeport) we've gone MONTHS without it being picked up.
Ever have your car booted only to find out that you indeed do not have any unpaid tickets? Because today was my second time in this city.
I'm considering spending most of May building a wedding gift.
@cindykomar I like the rainbow. How could anyone hate on a rainbow. Except for maybe a goth, but I'm pretty sure goths hate voting too.
I wonder when the Susan G Komen foundation will sue gay rights supporters for using pink in their profile images.
Update: Cab driver just took the CD out, and put in a different CD-R of water sound effects.
I am in an airport taxi van and the driver is blasting a CD of water sound effects. I'm only tweeting to make sure I'm not dreaming this.

Sup Portland. Sup Powell's. Can't wait to lug 60lbs of books across the continent.
@Saskrotch NJ was a close, but then I thought about the nice 85% of it. Idaho is like bad breath+poo+what I imagine fracking to smell like.
Tennessee is the best smelling state, as long as you're not in Memphis.
Idaho is the worst smelling state. I need to think about which is the best.
My rental car's audio system mixed up the tags of the newest Snoop Dog and the new @ceephax album. Very confusing 5 minutes.

Play Rez on Dreamcast at 8x speed, 2 inches from the screen with giant strobes on both sides of your head and it would probably be similar.
FYI: The welding goggles I'm wearing in the Treefield aren't a fashion thing. It is simply too disorienting to play an hour without them.
I can't go into detail just yet, but expect a full motion picture score derived from vintage arpeggiators and a full boys choir this year.
When your monopolized gas company sends people to your house with revolvers, you know it's time to consider moving to another city.
I will know I'm a boring old person when I've purchased a Winrar license.
I just yelled at my dog to stop whining and realized it was just my nose whistling.
@Mystyrion Yes. Website will be updated shortly.
After roughly 170 straight days of work, the Treefield set is complete. All is left is rehearsing and driving thousands of miles to test her
Why do 80% of females who live on the west coast have pictures of orbs as their profile images?
My work days are slowly moving from 12 hours to 17 hours. 16.5 if you don't count a dog walk. 16 if you don't count frequent coffee making.
Pro tip: Never buy a laptop without a separate GPU.
How should I punish the house full of hipsters who guessed my wifi pw and are torrenting as I speak? DD-Where, so endless possibilities.
I love it when people write me notes asking me to do things that take less time than writing notes.
30 years from now,our grandchildren will be wondering why every photo taken between 2009-2015 was ruined by an assortment of stupid filters.
Finally women are part of mainstream MMA, and my RSS feed is full of articles about @RondaRousey's sports bra almost falling off. Sigh.
@telefontelaviv = NIN. My favorite musicians and buds have merged into one incredible, gigantic ball of sound. A good day for ears!
Car dealership service dept waiting rooms should have suicide prevention pamphlets instead of auto magazines.
Thank you meteor for entering the earth in a country where everyone strangely has a DVR camera in their car 24/7.
I cannot seem to be more than 100ft from a subwoofer today.
Is it racist to be offended when someone calls your dog the N word? Think about that for a second.
When you are unfortunate enough to be a large-tall size, your options for wardrobe are either Hawaiian, or cowboy.
My dog's tireless enthusiasm while I search a nature preserve with an LED light for my car keys is pissing me off.
If an electronic musician is part of an "alliance", their album will be terrible. If a live show is called a "session", it will be terrible.
I'm going to hook up a clapper to my cable modem so I can stop climbing under my desk every hour when my connection needs resetting.

After already investing thousands out of pocket, I'm realizing that if you're not U2, you're simply not going to afford amazing live visuals
The smell on my clothes from a giant warehouse fire 2 blocks away has disturbingly made me hungry for s'mores.
Extreme use of performance enhancing drugs is probably the only thing that would make me watch a bunch of dudes ride bikes around France.
I wish my dog didn't take static electricity so personally.
I searched for the best places to find large-tall clothing and it auto-corrected the search to "best place to find tall women".

Decided to only drink mead tonight. #skyrim #dork
@Skyrail eek. Email kara@alphabasic.com with your order #, and it will ship right after Xmas.
Banning video games is definitely going to be more effective against violence than fixing our incredibly broken mental healthcare system.
Wow the world really is ending. Oh nvrmnd I just had Fox News satellite radio on in my car.
@raralarian Hit up mark@alphabasic.com with some ideas and your budget. The Ritz isn't interesting anyway. :)
@raralarian Pay me and put me in an interesting hotel. :P
The good news: I'm moving the entire warehouse back out of Chicago, and we will be returning to our glory. The store will be down for a day!
Alphabasic has sucked. The USPS in Chicago has botched quite a few of our orders, despite us having upgraded to a better shipping system.
If The Wire had another season that was about dogs, I just lived through it today.
Tis' the season when every company that you genuinely allowed to send you email promotions burns their bridges into oblivion.

I am the first non-religious person to own a Roland VP-770.
@acid_rain Oh wow, I could save a lot of money just doing this with CD orders.
On Dec 21st I was thinking of going to a small religious town in the south and leaving a bunch of empty wardrobes around.
@frewsxcvCC would only complicate things for myself, my publishers, and my attorneys. I would never sue a listener, so its not required.
@Daveed84 I'm also half through the game and have absolutely no idea who I am, where I'm at, or why I'm there. But it is my first AC game.
@Daveed84 I was a little annoyed about the Xbox registration process of ACIII, or any game that cripples you from buying/selling used.
Spending my day looking for a cat that has apparently had enough of the shenanigans in my house.
Nintendo, I'd buy a Wii-U today if you didn't intentionally under-produce to create a shortage. By the time it's in stock, psh,I'm over it.

I remember my grandfather saying that lifting too much would give me a hernia. Well, 20 years later, I learned the hard way.
In a week a Yamaha Disklavier piano with 0-latency MIDI ports will be sitting in my studio. This will be a very fun and lonely winter.
Obama - 303 | Romney - 206. Sure was an incredibly close election, like every news station in the country was saying.
Bought Windows 8 for my TV (running in a tiny zbox), and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed and delighted with it for this purpose.
Today is a really annoying day to have a Facebook account.
It works with Alphabasic demos too! Depending on if you sent jewel case or cardboard cd case. jk jk jk
My new mixing room is so quiet that I'm literally having trouble adjusting to the ringing of my own ears.
Moving my studio. Powering down Alphanet. It's going to be dark until next week.
That's 63% price increase that the artist almost never sees or even knows about. Fuck off, Metro.
2 Squarepusher tickets = $48. Squarepusher ticket + convenience, ticket, and facility fee = $78.34. Uh, yeah, maybe next time.
I dashed to my UPS store mailbox for my pre-order of Assassin's Creed III, nothing there, Charlie Brown theme played in my head. Thx Amazon
Whenever I watch a new Ableton Live release video, my reaction is: "WHOA! You mean you didn't have those features all this time???"
I had a dream that energy drinks were sponsoring the hurricane.
I love how a cops personality pulls a 180 when your breathilizer reading shows nothing but Slurpees.
@__MICHAELJ0RDAN: Heres a tip: those tricks you see in home alone dont work in real life. This day has been a big waste.
@jcs Do you know the story behind it? The Gracie academy was the #1 investor. It was basically a live Gracie commercial.
@Daveed84 The ONE journalist I sent a pre-release to already did.
You give an independent music journalist an hour phone interview and a pre-release copy of your album...and then they fucking leak it.
5 hours and 48 minutes until Hardscrabble is released!
@acid_rain She actually looked at the pre-orders for Hardscrabble and retired. haha
The paradox of me just making coffee without a filter is that it could've been prevented if I had the one thing I was attempting to make.
I need some kind of USB breathilizer to make sure I'm intoxicated before letting me read my Facebook newsfeed.
You know you're working too hard when Asian schoolgirls giggle at you, then pity you and help you carry construction supplies.
Did I just hear Mitt Romney accuse Chinese people of hacking our computers?
Also, @beatport responded to a cease and desist by telling me that they're not responsible for the legality of their own content. Okee doke.
If you ever want my music on @beatport, you can just find it from other people releasing my music witho permission and making money off of it.
@kmoare When Max can run for 30 minutes straight without crashing, I'll be all over it. Until then, Reaktor and Python for me!
Has anyone noticed a weird shortage or ban of Dannon yogurt recently? #bannon
@sacaitlin I would trade the settlement for them to abandon MOV format and never look back.
Taking legal action against Apple again. Maybe this is an every-4-year tradition.
No modern media outlet will ever report that an election isn't actually a close contest.
To clear up my previous Activision post, I think it is outrageous they'd remove a map over something so incredibly unimportant.
I hope whoever stole 3 bikes out of my garage wore some nice clothes for the security DVR footage I have of them sitting on this 2tb drive.
And in completing the mini-documentary, I secretly recorded some DISTURBING police corruption. Just wow.
I find it troubling that starting a corporation took me 48 hours and starting a 501(c)(3) charity will likely take another year if approved.
Amnesia: Dark Descent is merely a pixelated version of when I've looked for my building's circuit breakers while drunk at 3am.
It's Monday, the day of the week when Mitt Romney resets his campaign strategy.
I'm playing a game with Office Depot where I give them valid coupon codes, and they give me a pop up box excuses why they won't accept it.
Doing a LIVE interview on WGN/Channel 9 about the balloon launch at 5pm. hahaha
How to use a boomerang. (1-Buy boomerang online. (2-Pick it up from UPS store (3-Throw it in the park at 11pm (4-Look for it for 90 minutes.
My dog literally just flung her toy lamb out the window.
Budget for my next live performance's visual show: 14 million USD. Not joking. Stay tuned.
Flight #2. The line snapped and my Gopro + 64gb SD card are somewhere in the upper stratosphere.
@Alisonsevers How many thumbs up did you count in the blooper reel?
@monsieursalami I have a collection of old tape recorders!
Sending a camera over a mile high tonight, and that's just for inside album artwork.
I just realized that the iPhone 5 is the first one that supports 4G. lol
Why does it still take 7-10 business days to transfer money? Is the cash put on a bank mule that walks it to your local branch?
If Manhattan had as many people per square mile as Alaska, there would be 14 people in Manhattan.
@Defining_Line I do. In my opinion it is the most featured and intuitive DAW interface, especially with the unique VST plugin routing.
Wealthy republicans, you should understand that helping the poor to upper-middle class will let them spend money on crap to make you richer.
@derekTroberts Yup. It takes immense patience and time of course. Sometimes I feel like I don't even need the audio turned on anymore. heh.
@derekTroberts It makes "looping" or "redundancy" a lot more difficult to slip into, for me anyway.
@derekTroberts I often just have one pattern with like 30 long MIDI tracks, then recorded stuff in the "song mode".
@CaptainErsatz Sure, or your old high school yearbook.
@_SmithCommaJohn I believe Kontakt comes with 1 or 2 microtonal script presets as well.
@_SmithCommaJohn Sure. If the synth is an FL native you can just edit the pitch/cents in the piano roll. Better yet is Kontakt scripts.
Not really pro tip: You can remove the grid in FLStudio by replacing a few bitmap files.
I've been working on a track for weeks with no grid, quantizing, or bpm. Going to do this a lot more often in the future.
@1555filmworks Looks great. Anything I can do to help?
Somehow my walk to get food resulted in a Nintendo 3DS XL purchase.
Just setup a hotel style wifi system all over my building using dd-wrt'd routers and a powerline ethernet kit. eL1T3
Driving 2 miles is taking an hour bc in a bit some guy will attempt to hit a cloth-wrapped ball with sticks and 40,000 people want to watch.
Today I looked at my wall of Pussy Riot albums and posters and thought: "I can't believe this is happening to my favorite band of all time".
While my day is definitely ruined, I'm still impressed at US Custom's ability to find things in my car that I didn't know existed.
I decided to try Linkedin, and now it apparently emailed everyone I've ever emailed and I have no idea how to use it. Sorry.
Everyone at Vancouver airport is carrying hockey sticks.
Seattle green room kind of looks like the room at the end of Boogie Nights.
@hipdeathg0ddess Yup. Just played there in June.
Last American gig in Seattle tonight. My back is so knotted that I may move around like Ozzy Osbourne on stage.
Olympia, WA. Denny's, Red Lobster, Super 8, Cabella's, Target. Not exactly being a good tourist.
@justinmcgrath nothing severe thankfully. I notice my blood sugar is usually a culprit though.
Long term sleep deprivation peaking.Ibuprofen, ephedrine, ecigs to the rescue.
@justinmcgrath: I have a sudden urge to make Selected Ambient Works Volume 2 ringtones and notification sounds for myself.
Playing an indy backyard gig in Olympia, WA on Tues night. Will be playing Rise Of Nations in a Super 8 with @bartelmusicnthere on Monday.
@protman Yeah, every existing phone with a physical keyboard is shite. I use a fold up Bluetooth keyboard for long emails when traveling.
I did the math. For me, Google Maps has had a 27% accuracy with a location actually existing or a phone number being correct.
@bartelmusic Hope you didn't buy long board. Kara wants me to take her mattress pad kok
I'm always intrigued by California's ability to crush your spirit within 60 minutes of entrance.
Nevermind, they've progressed to Skrillex now. Anyone know of any 24 hour gun shops in Wyoming?
Small Wyoming town, 6 miles from I-80, 2 miles from sea level, and someone is blaring psytrance outside my motel window. I guess I'm in hell
@bammtv: Tweet @bammtv your best road trip pic for a chance to win tix to The Flashbulb and; @Bartelmusic show Aug. 4th in #SF! ht ...
If you talk to me on this tour, it is likely you'll be videotaped. We are sparing nothing and nobody the wrath of the Go Pros.
I think it's safe to say that last night was one of the finest audiences I've had the honor to play for. NYC exceeded expectations 200 fold!
2nd day of tour. Debit card cloned. Checking account drained. Chase bank yawning. This will be an interesting series of events.
Rural Pennsylvania is pretty creepy in the wee hours.
Myself and Bartel are playing Rebar in Seattle on Aug 8th. Ticket link coming soon.
Very riled to visit friends and places in NYC tomorrow! Show is Friday night.
@ericcwhitaker This one still has too much data, but handles it more like a story of a legend than a literal and linear sequence of events.
@ericcwhitaker I didn't seem to care about any of the characters in the 2 previous ones. This one had a bit more subjective abstraction.
Contrary to popular opinion; Dark Knight Rises was the only one in the trilogy I thought was a great film. Golf clap.
@dillingerescpln Ah boo! I'm in NYC Jul 27th - 29th.
I'm ashamed that my country turns every tragedy into a personal political agenda. We don't know how to be sad, only loud and selfish.
Starting Wednesday, everyone on this tour has to wear a Gopro on their head for a minimum of 2 hours a day.
@dillingerescpln Will you be back in NY next weekend?
Food poisoning certainly puts a stick in the spokes of your ambitious daily work out routine.
@sacaitlin I've never heard his stand up. I just added it to my drive for tour next week.
@sacaitlin Because instead of just walking out, she decided to interrupt a show that everyone else paid to see. Open game.
@bartelmusic: New record is done, gunna share the new stuff on tour a bit, finish er off in august.
It is a divine and appreciated coincidence that the person I spend most of my time with is also obsessed with Red Lobster.
@AnaTheVillain Wow. I don't think I've listened to it more than 3 or 4 times! haha
The worst part about reading half of "50 Shades Of Grey" was that I have it on my Nook, thus couldn't violently throw it in the trash.
Ever since Spotify, I learned that my female Facebook friends only listen to fast paced acoustic guitar power chord music with male vocals.
@Machine_Drum I actually have intentionally dropped something below their feet, then take over the armrest when they politely pick it up.
@GorgeousFace I say you should just hop on a car/bus/train/horse to the NYC gig and I'll talk them into giving me a bed on stage.
@GorgeousFace Hmm. What city? Is it a king size? I have a lot of gear.
Apparently the Portland show for July/August is not happening. Sad. If anyone wants to book Aug 7th in PDX, email mark@alphabasic.com
I wish power outages happened on days where it was 70f outside. But that wouldn't make much sense, would it.
The hardest part of quitting smoking is the sudden overwhelming realization that my neighborhood smells like old nacho cheese.
Massive thumb puncture wound while opening a package of nicotine patches. (Cue: Curb Your Enthusiasm Theme)
I'm announcing that I'm quitting smoking on Twitter so I'll feel like that much more of an ass if I change my mind tomorrow.
I certainly wouldn't have lost so much sleep watching Jericho had I known they abruptly pulled the plug on the series mid-story.
@SavannahTurk Agreed. I can't even associate myself with someone after seeing them do it. So selfish and shortsided.
I hate free Slurpee day because it means that when I want a legitimate Slurpee at 2am, they'll be out of Coke and Cherry.
@Skype Does that fact that people are developing rogue versions of your software to make it less bulky and unstable motivate you at all?
@Machine_Drum Fack! We're playing almost all the same cities, but a week apart!
I need to write a 50 page PDF listing the reasons why I don't have my music on Beatport. But I'll need a lawyer on retainer first.
@jaredburgin Sure, if there seemed to be enough interest.
Everyone is saying "like whoa" at the end of their sentences lately. Can someone fill me in on what new piece of culture I missed?
FYI: I stalk my new Twitter followers on a daily basis while waiting for my dog to run aimlessly around the nearby park.
@GorgeousFace Morbid is almost always hilarious, to me anyway.
$54.99 was well worth Anderson Silva's passive aggressive victory speech.
@THCMUSIC Who the hell cares about soundcloud plays?
The key to enjoying July 4th noise is to imagine the mangled body of the person setting off the distant firework flying 25ft into the air.
I was just applauded by a group of Microcenter customers for bullying a Camaro owner who thought his car deserved 2 spaces. +50 Self-esteem
@jjn8 In the end Alfred would get drunk and molest Rachel, distracting Batman while driving, with the movie ending right before his death.
Just pushed a motorbike 3.5 miles. Guess I can cancel my gym membership for July.
Who has two thumbs and will be getting heat stroke on the side of the road in the ghetto?
Who has two thumbs and thought driving a brand new scooter 100 miles in 100f heat all day wouldn't result in gear oil evaporating? This guy!
I did not know that Facebook comes as a preinstalled application on new computers. Uninstalled.
You could give my dog datura and methamphetamines, or blow off some fireworks a few blocks away. Same result.
I discovered that "chi chi man" is a reference to homosexuals. I'm ashamed for not realizing this when sampling Elephant Man in Dr. Lefty :
Well, my head and face are closely shaved. If I ever go to prison in my life, hopefully it will be this week so I get grouped in easily.
@telefontelaviv: EMI has an anthology of electronic music without Autechre in it at all. #LOOOOL.
I sadly will need to limit my Tweets to gig/album announcements. Blah. I'll try and setup something social and legal at the same time.
@bgilstein Only on the way down. Then barrel prices go up, it takes about 15 seconds for the pump to change. :-
Worst Chicago traffic yet. Proof: I'm tweeting and responding to emails on a motorcycle on an expressway.
Oil has tanked to $80 a barrel, while gas prices are higher than when it peaked at $145 a barrel. Greasy.
I hate the moment in the early AM when you look at a clock and it becomes apparent that you're actually not going to sleep.
I just successfully destroyed someone's bedroom and impaled myself with tiny shards of glass while helpingphotograph dolls for eBay.
@Alisonsevers Do you still do that type of work? There's some doc makers I occasionally work with that seem to be in need of a host.
@Alisonsevers Really enjoyed your journalist work with Vice. I'm going to pitch you to some production agencies if you don't mind. :)
@Surachai Check out the big abandonedtheater. The church is great too.
Wait! San Fran August 4th. Sorry. I'm brain dead!
FINALLY. Confirmed. The Flashbulb + Bartel in San Francisco, July 4th. Details to come!
Musik Produktion Tip: Be successful enough to hire people to carry your 400lbs of gear by the time you reach your 30's. @tiger_balm_us
I've decided to do all the Adler Planetarium compositions with my own software, probably because it feels more scientific.
90mph on a motorcycle after having not slept 38 hours created a general mental state I have not experienced before.
If you win the lotto, 80% of your winnings should go to reparations for all of the people standing in line behind you while you picked #'s.
@justinmcgrath What do you call a 6 legged insect that has no digital components on it?
@EthanMyers June 15th @ The Smiling Buddahn19+ 10$ before 11pm After 15$n8pm - 3amn961 College StreetnToronto, Canada
Ohio. Shooting semi-automatic weapons. Blazing around a tree farm on super charged ATV. Procrastinating restringing a guitar.
Sleep is the cousin of death. ...or at least that's what I tell myself after giving up on it after a couple hours of laying in bed.
If I were a devout Christian, as Scott Walker walked out on CNN and thanked God for his reelection, I'd smash my television with a crucifix.
I think it is inevitable that this will be the weekend where I will try Doritos tacos.
@EricGMeyer Looks cool. For licensing/composing hit up mark@alphabasic.com with details and we'll see what we can do.
I never thought I'd hear so many N-bombs while watching a little league baseball game.
Life tip: If you don't want to smoke your own fingernails, don't clip them into an ashtray.
Today was my first experience giving a random stranger in Bridgeport a ride on a motorbike. It is definitely my last.
The best part of building your empire is burning it down with plans to build an even better one.
Chicagoans: I'll be composing original music for a massive interactive deep space exhibit at the Adler Planetarium opening in July.
Android 4.0 automatically and completely restores your new phone to where your destroyed phone was before it was destroyed. Impressed!
At some point I'm just going to paint my whip like a taxi.
72 hours from last take to first editing draft. I'm getting adept at this film thing.
Pouring rain mid dog walk? Put your smokes and phone in an unused poop bag, ya doofus!
@ceephax I put a bunch of Latin ones into a blender and it just turned into gunpowder. Weird.
In South Dakota with a car full of sleeping bags and Walmart groceries.
...so it really isn't an insult when I tell them to go fuck themselves.
74% of the time, the male and female in a hipster couple uncannily look like each other.
Photographing intense fog &gt; Catching up on sleep
I will be playing twice tonight, if you count the poker room at Motor City Casino. Maybe I will recruit an entourage.
1. Order Indian food. 2. Pick up Indian food. 3. Indian food goes bad in the hour it takes to drive 3 miles home. ...Chicago.
Makeup and camera fx just got traded for hiring a CG team. Making videos is a learning experience.
I love how hot/humid/low pressure air suppresses sound waves. Just an eerie blanket of silence where one would expect an abundance of noise.
I'd rather know what the person who installed light switches on the OUTSIDE of my bathroom's doors looks like. And if they're mentally ill.
I never understand some people's desire to know who a musician is dating, or even what they look like.
Idea of the day. @Youtube should automatically make videos mono when they only have audio in one speaker.
...that being said, it stopped being dubstep about 120 seconds into the first session.
What started as me making dubstep as a joke to myself turned into the last month of making the most technical music of my life.
There's nothing cooler than sending ideas to a developer and seeing them implemented in the next update. &lt;3 you guys! @FL_Studio
Sox hit home run - fireworks are deployed at stadium 3 blocks away - dog barks uncontrollably. This would be so cool if I liked baseball.
People seem to take you more seriously when you have a black eye and a smirk on your face.
Calling tonight an adventure would be a massive understatement.
My entire day/evening has been officially wasted by multiple people's inability to keep plans. There has to be a solution for this.
Soft mallet sounds with 20 seconds of high end reverb &gt; pads.
@comcast Charged $599 to my debit card, disconnected my service, cannot get it restored without technicians coming. All on "accident". wha??
It's time to shoot my friends with 300fps paintballs.
Serious post: the child prostitution in this city makes me want to chill atop buildings sniping wanna-be pimp after pimp.
Last night, every weather site/station apparently played the April fools joke of telling Chicago it would be 79f today.
@ceephax Let's do Nebraska and Kansas again this summer.
@sinicalypse6 jesus christ SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU ALIEN.
Today Walgreen's accused me of fraud and "red flagged" me for trying to refill my prescription a week before I ran out of pills. lol.
@sinicalypse6 whaa? I'm so lost.@ChiLakeshoreHos
That being said, I am doing a DJ SET at Smart Bar this evening. :)
When a flyer/newspaper says The Flashbulb (DJ Set), that means I will be doing a DJ set, not a live performance of my own material.
Marketing success story: Young people who protest Warmart and shop at Target, which is partially owned by Mitt Romney.
I am updating my twitter account by talking to my car
I can't decide if I want to go night fishing or build a camp fire out in the forest preserves tonight. Life is full of hard decisions.
87F in Chicago, in March. If this is the apocalypse, it's worth it.
Can't complain about a freelance job that involves me re-transcribing Debussy on my roof top deck in 72f weather.
I am going to put a piece of meat on my grill and not post a picture of it on Facebook.
I just spent 20 minutes watching a live stream of Deadmau5 play with a modular synth as if a raccoon was playing a Nintendo DS.
Never order from a Chinese place that has music on its site while you're composing eastern music for a TV show. I'm psychologically injured.
I guess it is just one of those "spill Jamba Juice on your dog" type of days.
Some hipsters were playing Frisbee in the park & one of them said "we should like make one of our sketches about hipsters playing Frisbee"
... with giant fat fingers and a touchscreen keyboard
What part of my personality has welcomed so many drunk dials this morning? I am a reclusice, grumpy old man with a sinus infection.
Kontakt 5 is impressive. It not only crashes the plugin, not only the session, but the whole machine to be rebooted into recovery mode. Wow!
I keep staring at the 10 day forecast like it was a picture of a truck full of guitars being delivered to me next week.
I wonder what % of popular music is simply a 70/80's track with a vocal hook or sample over it. This is a dark reality.
@barberk007 Well, no, not when the region is currently in a ceasefire between many guerrilla forces and you remove one of them.
It is a grand occasion when eating dinner and working are two separate activities. There will be no grand occasions this week.
I wonder how much lower the gang population would be if they were informed their duties would be making various animal sounds in the street.
I feel like I've worked 40 hours in the last 12 hours.
Detroit, thanks for such an epic turnout and gig! Tonight I will be finally returning home to cuddle w my dog and watch The Walking Dead.
Detroit hotel room #: 303. Date: 303. AAA discount on hotel rooms: $30.30.
First improvised guitar show, stressful setup/rehearsal but turned out a sound success.
I have to wake up at 7am and attend a funeral at a catholic mass. I'm slightly worried that I will burst into flames upon entering.
Ghost Hunters did an episode on the hotel we're staying in. More specifically on the floor we're staying on. Riled.
Netflix in new car with surround sound in middle of nowhere Minnesota. 2012 boys.
@PolishKatiee Thanks! Yeah hopefully I'm not playing too late so I can hang out and yack it up after. :)
Tomorrow I will wake and live the day in character as an incredibly sociopathic asshole. Why? Because I'm negotiating and buying a new car.
The only thing Oregon Trail taught me was that if you bring other people along they just eat the food you hunt and set your wagon on fire.
I'll bet you didn't know that Guitar Center is owned by Mitt Romney. Well it is.
I didn't get any flowers. I also don't have a mailing address.
I should note that last year's Grammy for new jazz album was given to Joe Zawinul, who died in 2007. Maybe Debussy will win one this year?
Why is anyone surprised when shitty artists win Grammy awards? A Grammy is an award for pop stars, not prestige musical excellence.
I was just sent a You Rock Guitar. 10 minutes in and I'm adjusting controller variables with midiox. So far, fun. Useful? We'll seeee...
@Grooveshark I have emailed your artists address.
@SkinBintin @Grooveshark It's a for-profit company. File sharing is great, but turning profit witho the IP holder's permission is ridiculous.
@jameshartig @ehubinette @Grooveshark I have, twice, and have received no response.
@SkinBintin I'm all for file sharing. I'm not all for charging $60 a year for music without asking the artists.
Not really thrilled that @Grooveshark streams my entire discography without ever requesting permission. It's an uphill battle, I tell ya.
...and like anything with Apple (especially when paired with Gracenote), minutes of work turn into hours of banging your head against a table.
Must. Install. iTunes. And. Type. Out. Tracklist. Before. Someone. Botches. It. Forever. Like. With. My. Last. Album.
@derekTroberts Some of them. Paying my people overtime. :-
@TINYPEEPEE Digital will be released Friday morning.
@Sabresister42 Doing a solo guitar gig in Pittsburgh the night before. Might make it more worth a trip to the midwest!
ever hear of anyone being kicked out of a post office for having too many packages to ship? 2 Alphabasic employees were this afternoon!
Is my Gamestop the only one where activation/redeemable codes aren't included in the product, but sold to you separately by a guy in front?
it's one of those days where I need the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme playing over me every 10 minutes.
2 more hours til Stanley Jordan live and 1 more week til The Walking Dead resumes season 2. &lt;3
The manufacturers for Opus have frustratingly gone beyond their promised completion time. Shipping for all preorders will now be on Feb10th.
Alright. It's been a month and I simply can't text without a slide out keyboard.
Cheers of the day goes to the towing company that had me wake up at 10am, demanded I stay home til 7pm to wait for them, and never showed.
@jcs What I love about Android 4 is how the back button no longer flings you into another application.
Revised: Thanks to @jcs for making the recovery possible. A hacker in Holland made the whole situation possible.
Officially on hour 24 of going through php files and securing the hacked sites. My brain is lasagna. Thanks to @jcs for making it possible.
Thru this process I'm realizing I own a staggering amount of my ex-gf's domains, still hosting their art project sites they never updated.
Alphabasic was hacked. We managed to fix it before getting to track 10 in Pink Floyd's "The Wall".
Tunecore is going after monetization cash from my own music video that I uploaded to my own Youtube account, and they may actually win. lol.
Today is one of those "I am Michael in Arrested Development" days.
Bridgeport has never looked more like Fallout 3.
This has to be the only place on earth where you can get struck by lightning while shoveling your car out of its parking spot.
Having an entourage in uniform is a hilarious luxury I hope to experience in the future.
I love Newt Gingrich. I'm sorry. I hate his ideas, and his values. But I can't get enough. I may vote for him just for my future amusement.
I really want a black soft fabric track suit with hot pink lining/stripes, and matching shoes. That is too much to ask of this universe.
It's a tight race for jaw-dropping incompetence. Insurance company of the guy who totaled my car VS. CD Manufacturer for Opus.
Looks like I'll be gone for most of Feb and March playing some solo guitar shows. Looking forward to hitting the road raw musician style.
Tomorrow is the day where I send back all the Xmas gifts people haven't claimed yet. Grinchy, but also 16 days of boxes in my kitchen.
I may be the only Verizon customer with unlimited 4G. :)
New phone switch. Aka temportary sms blackout/lose your number day.
Blasting Steve Reich with open windows. The most magical ghetto alley in Chicago.
Is it gross to order used high-end ear buds so I don't have to deal with burning them in?
Wikihow just tweeted my Chicago Winter article. Hopefully I can find something else I'm good at.
Adding "of klansmen" at the end of your fortune cookie reading is a pretty great game.
Sold out show tonight. That's not very common in Chicago these days. My new years wish is for a secured and well ventilated green room.
Nashville tuning/stringing on an old acoustic changing my life.
Saturday night stage lineup: 9:45 - Polyfuse, 10:30 - Abominable Twitch, 11:15 - The Flashbulb
Attempting to do a small USA tour in Feb. All improv guitar/drums/loop pedals/etc. Sit down venues preferred. mark@alphabasic.com 4 booking
FYI: A smokey factory in China is making the preorder surprise for Opus At The End Of Everything. And it is going to take forever to be done
While playing Tiger Woods it started raining in the game, and my dad came in and wrang out a wet wash cloth over my uncle's head.
I just accidentally searched a torrent site for Napoleon Dinosaur.
Tomorrow I'm going to an Italian barber and getting this hobo head cleaned the hell up.
A letter of recommendation is really difficult to write if you don't want to sound like you've had a gay relationship with the person.
New album material rings in at 110 minutes. I guess it is time to carefully trim.
Bandcamp sent me a shirt and a handwritten thank you letter. Can you imagine Apple doing this for artists that keeps iTunes in business?
Maybe I drank too many Slurpees, but I think I'm going to release this EP in about an hour. #benefitsofowningyourownrecordlabel
I just searched "how to ask a girl on a date". It's a good thing I don't have a mirror in my studio.
Releasing an EP next week. First digital release of mine. 4 versions of the same track. Amazing remixes by Bartel and Abominable Twitch.
When you quit drinking for 6+ months, people who drunk text/dial you just start to seem mentally disabled.
I wonder if my next full length will get poor reviews because I'm refusing to participate in the out of control electronica loudness war.
One word to describe my dog's first in life reaction to snow: concerned.
Know why I hate iPhones? I get text spammed and then 20 messages responding to it not directed at me due to the 'reply-all' functionality.
Someone replaced my Xbox setup with a 47 inch glitchy iPad.
I need to hire someone to play with my riled up dog today.
These R0de mics are so sensitive they pick up the fizz of an open soda can upstairs. Took me about an hour to figure out what I was hearing
I just calculated that the minimum amount of mice hooked up to reins to pull the weight of my dog around in the snow is 38.
Got a 5am prank call from a group of drunk girls that just froze up and forgot what to say until I just hung up from boredom. Good one guys.
My social life needs some carefully organized restructuring.
I just realized that the place I order Thai food from isn't actually a business, but a woman who makes noodles for her friends/family.
I want to apologize for Alphabasic being a bit slower w shipping and responding to emails, as well as myself w personal msgs this month.
Chai tea, frother, new kettle will pay for itself in 16 days (not including tip). Sorry Bridgeport Coffee House, your 'tude got me all DIY.
Want to use up 8 CPU cores? 4 128 band vocoders modulated with Voxos in real time. Sounds better than the VP-770 tho!
The Walking Dead has impressively bloomed from the best zombie production to possibly the best television series of the decade.
Reaktor is killing me with these bloated interface updates.
I am going to buy a bulk of something from China and give the same xmas gift to everyone. That way they get much more for my buck.
Well good news, they've deemed my car as a total loss. Now we'll see what insulting price the insurance company will put on it.
At McDonalds, if your staff cannot produce hamburgers, and blame each other for this happening, you hire a new staff. McDonalds &gt; Congress.
I have an idea. If congress doesn't reach an agreement by their deadline, they're all fired without benefits.
Even in the world of The Walking Dead, everyone's biggest problem is a hot woman's sequence of dishonest soapboxery. Realistic I must say!
I'm thinking I might show up to this car insurance company in person tomorrow and walk into the adjuster's office wearing an army uniform.
Snow boots. Check. Military balaclava. Check. Thermal pants. Check. Touch screen capable gloves. Check.
Everyone is really hostile today. It's like a much less severe version of the virus in 28 Days Later.
At some point in my life I'm going to book myself somewhere as The Flashbulb and then do an hour long magic show instead.
@ensoi if only everyone felt that way, my curse would be lifted. :)
I have transformed my dog's digging on me for attention into quite an satisfying back scratching operation.
I was really expecting the final mission of Rage to be longer and more challenging.
This new Korg M50 makes Modern Warfare 3 invisible to me.
Waking up at 6am to get Lucy's lady parts removed. I plan for that to reset my sleeping schedule to that of a more motivated person.
Day long interview. Bring in the Arizona Arnold Palmers.
Does Ebay send anyone else monthly invoices for $0.00?
A jazz musician doing a classical composing job is like an off-road motorcycle driver driving a subway train.
There were lots of white 20-somethings dressed as dickheads at the cafe today for Halloween. Oh...wait...
Had a great night meeting with Herbie Hancock + comparing our work/performance rituals. The future holds some crazy plans. Inspired & riled!
You know you're a freelance composer when your blow-out-candle-birthday-wish is to be paid owed money by your employers.
I can't understand why people who aren't farmers own composters. Or how anyone can own a Tempur-Pedic mattress. Still trying to grasp iPads
Today I will seek out and kill whoever mastered Coldplay's new record.
Listening to new recordings and walking my dog in the cold makes me feel like a ghost. Not really in a good way.
I have finally sorted out my MIDI headaches with the improvised live setup. Now 6 months of practice and I'll be ready for another tour. :P
@herbie__hancock looking forward to meeting you in Chicago (well, Naperville) on Saturday!
Doing some ROM experiments on my phone. I will be untextable/unreachable for a while.
Whenever I receive a PDF to sign, I make it my days goal to return it in the same quality, but with a smaller file size. I'm psychotic.
Note/Feedback: I will never tour performing CD versions of songs from a laptop, because it is incredibly boring to me.
@Surachai When commenting on a couple that looked alike: "If they reproduce their kids are going to look like themselves."
Yay - I'm allowed to upgrade my smartphone. Boo - if I do I can kiss unlimited data goodbye. Unlimited 3G &gt; Bandwidth Limited 4G
Considering bringing drums and more instruments on tour and going full improv/midi/loop pedals for an hour. Maybe a small try-out tour?
Why the hell have I spent so much time this year learning magic tricks?
Previous post is why South Chicago &gt; North Chicago.
Making piles of french toast for a team of graffiti artists who are painting an enormous Charlie Brown/Great Pumpkin scene on the building.
A group of protesters handed me a clipboard and pen today and said "You have the right to breath clean air". I had a cigarette in my mouth.
Making a nickname for yourself and writing it on my door with a paint marker is by far the most incredible art concept I've ever witnessed.
Looking forward to the next year of hilarity with these OS X and iOS viruses springing up with no built-in security to protect against them.
Lucy's got sit, stay, lay down, roll over, leave it, off, no, come, go get it, and go to your kennel all locked in.
I wish I wouldn't feel incredibly elitist to put a sticker on my my next album that advises to listen on good headphones/monitors only.
Nothing is worse than yawning in the middle of a session and your ear's entire EQ band is moved to a different preset.
Skype has a cool new feature where you have to ctrl-alt-del and use task manager to exit the program. Cool! Keep up the good work boys.
Every haunted house in Chicago has been voted the #1 haunted house in Chicago.
Answer to common youtube/twitter/email question: The music in the beginning of the promo will not be on album. I made it in 8 minutes.
I am way way way way way too anal retentive about programming vocoders.
Classic quote - Me in a truckstop: "Should we get one of these dreamcatchers for the car?"Cylob: "If your dream is to be a faggot."
There is so much misinformation circling this occupy(insert city) crowd that it turned something incredible into something embarrassing.
& thanks for all the get well messages/texts/voicemails! I should have a giant "supervise benn in case of seizure party".
Today I learned that busting the top of your head open can cause temporary epilespy. I need a permanent helmet. Or better coordination.
I feel like I've had the most intense sensation of Slurpee brain freeze for 14 hours and running.
Bashed my head open in the stupidest way possible. Ambulance. Butterfly clips. Bloody hands. The works.
Welp, Naked Gun is on Netflix. Not sleeping til 8am.
Bridgeport is a place where big hair, windbreakers, and mustaches are mutually shared by out of style residents and hipsters mocking them.
I gotta say it: Nearly every bleeding heart video of police vs. activists starts with these kids acting confrontational and over-dramatic.
Told OfficeMax cashier that if he honors a bunk $20 off coupon I will request that his manager carry my computer chair to my car. It worked.
Rainy, warm, sunny, hot, rainy, cold, windy, sunny, warm, rainy, windy, freezing today.
I am using my head cold as an excuse to play video games all night.
I am disturbingly shocked that the leading GOP candidate is someone who proposes repealing all corporate taxes.
My mother just stopped eating, looked at my father, and said "are you on Twitter?". He said "nope". Resume eating. Directed by David Lynch.
In a race to finally get to sleep before the sun rises.
My Dad wanted to talk about something I lied about: which ended up being that I "caught a coyote and spray painted it claiming it was a dog"
If you see a pile of work with 2 beady eyes peaking out at you from underneath it, that's where I've been hiding.
Shooting tonight back in Chicago with an F/1.0 and shoulder mount at Debonair and later an east Englewood alley. God help me.
I was charged by an angry bison this morning. I leaped off the top of a grassy cliff to escape. Basically Die Hard if it was based in 1870.
Completed my first official day as a film producer/cinematographer. Whew.
Got stung by a wasp in the middle of nowhere South Dakota. It has been a fun epinephrine adrenaline ride.
Scrabble in South Dakota. Long days/nights of shooting ahead of us.
This F/1.0 is GIANT and much much heavier than I even imagined.
Must eat all cereal in house before leaving to not waste milk.
Rental car, rental lens, config new cameras, install codecs, pack, drop dog off at "grandma's", pickup director and actress, drive 13 hours.
This whole smoke engulfing Chicago thing is actually making my eyes burn.
Renting a $7,000 lens for a video shoot in South Dakota this coming week. I will learn what it is like to carry and infant around.
Really into gated snare reverb lately. Too bad the world hasn't been into it since 1986.
@ensoi Looks like a few thousand miles is preventing me.
Had another earthquake dream last night. I'm going to be really freaked out if there is a major one tomorrow.
First and last weekend I'll spend writing palindromic music.
A beagle across the alley is howling along to my session work. When I stop, he stops. I feel like a conductor.
If you listen to Coltrane's Giant Steps and watch my dog, it all starts to make sense.
Dear Chase Bank, go ahead and take another week to send me the new debit card you forced me to get. I can eat trash and smoke dried shrubs.
Nothing like writing Tomorrow Untrodden completely backwards on piano and then reversing the audio.
I have completed 38 tracks so far in 2011. Good year.
I am becoming an expert at mixing 40 tube distorted tracks.
Just got front row seat tickets to Herbie Hancock and an fancy invite to an after-show private reception...on my birthday. :::swoon:::
So many people apparently forced at gunpoint to watch the VMAs against their will and complaining about it online.
Remember a time when we could have a hurricane without people psychotically rambling about a US government/HAARP conspiracy to create it?
Riled for the Silva Vs. Okami match tonight. $ on Silva, of course.
Unfortunately my dog doesn't understand that it is National Dog Day...or the concept of holidays...or even the Gregorian calendar.
Today I did my laundry, got a 2 hour haircut while watching MMA at a manly barbershop, and fell down an entire flight of stairs. Eh, not bad
I absolutely love the new Washed Out album on my monitors. I kind of dislike it in my car. Weird.
Dogs are significantly more fascinated with your music making process when you're using hardware sequencers/synths.
@JenFriel Cool. Have fun! I'm going midnight fishing. :)
While walking my pup in the park I met an astronomer who is writing custom code for Canon SLRs. He invited me to a space balloon launch. &lt;3
Welp. My eye is twitching and I have more gray hair. But I dismantled every appliance in my kitchen and found the mouse corpse. Yay for me.
I've been working on music today with chatroulette open on another computer with the monitor turned off.
Nothing like returning to a session that you worked on at 4am while half asleep and just holding your head in your hands for 10 minutes.
I am willing to do just about anything for someone to figure out exactly where this dead mouse is and get it the f out of my house.
The amount of Wii games I would buy if they would just let me use a normal paddle controller is staggering.
Got a copyright infringement notice from OM Records today about a Youtube video with my own music in it. Good one, boys.
Facebook finally served an actual purpose in my social life by transforming a comment into an all out Scrabble tournament.
Well boys, fuckin' meteors flying all over this place.
Hey everyone, I found the most polarized controversial topic on the internet: shock collars.
When I see someone on their macbook outside a cafe fr hours boxing their vision to see the screen, I wonder w the rest of their day is like.
Lucy, last day of not being crate trained on my Nazi Google Calendar dictating when you eat, drink, and poo. Live it up Lucy, live it up.
@bartelmusic is insisting I Tweet about a dream I had where a devastating earthquake takes place on September 6th, just in case it happens.
Lady, Mercury moving in the opposite direction of the Earth has nothing to do with the fact that you can't operate a fucking cash register.
I've reached the age where I cannot digest pizza.
Waking up went from being a long groggy process to an immediate task list motivated by raw puppy energy.
When you gain the ability to sleep in a crowded venue, you lose the ability to stay awake during a movie.
Puppy first day. Holding pee until outside. Hasn't barked once. Either I'm really lucky or Lucy is the second child of God.
I hope the White Sox lose. Simply because of their hiring choice in traffic enforcement officers.
So riled by it that I couldn't type it correctly.
I just witnessed someone with a license plate that says "banshee" run into a telhone pole
Tour is officially over. I'm going to buy a puppy and watch TV with it for a week. Any name suggestions for a female papillon?
@ChrisSlugma Donut place was closed but we went berserk with mortars on the Wisconsin countryside.
@unfolding Thanks! I hope you enjoyed it. Let me know if you ever make it down to Chicago.
@justinmcgrath a few weeks ago I had to go to the ER from reaching into my guitar case and slicing my hand on a broken beer bottle inside.
Sometime soon I'm going to sleep for more than 4 hours.
@kckimchi Ceephax sounds amazing and is much less hot on the roof of my tour van.
Every day I say "jesus, I'm going to pass out while performing in this 110f venue", but somehow I don't. I probably smell horrible though.
Swapping hard drives with young lady strangers until 6am. I am going to write the most boring musician's memoir to have ever existed.
Listening to 2 guys debating my guitar playing style while sitting in a venue bathroom stall between them. Does that mean I've "made it"?
Every night for 2 weeks: Strip down to underwear, put on comfy headphones, fall asleep to Trailer Park Boys. A recipe for good dreams.
Checking the heat index in Chicago with hypothermia from body surfing and trying to figure out if what I'm looking at is a rock or a whale.
Getting my brains sucked out of my head at the US/Canadian border as usual. Maybe I will just camp here this time.
The mountain pass on the border of Montana and Idaho has never ceased to make me nervous and carsick.
@unter_null Just hang out where you're comfortable, in the kitchen counter area.
Packing light seems so pointless when staring at my 12 cubic feet of gear.
@MrDutton: Facebook ruined "happy birthday" like teenage girls ruined "I love you"
I have an "I don't know these aliens" list on Google+ that 95% of my friend requests are being dragged to.
I open my guitar case to grab a cable and my hand returns spraying out blood. Oh, there's a broken Bud Light bottle in it. Somehow. Sigh.

@nuhangthegamer @PlayOverwatch lol too much excitement, a little creepy...ZOOM OUT!
@yongz303 you should have received a code when you purchased it if not contact the retailer.
@iluminat3thesky @nvidia if you're asking about being VR Ready, we suggest to have at least a GTX 970 to be VR Ready.
@dezi_rosado @MountainDew haven't tried the black label yet, how is it?
@Jaker_GG Grats on the upgrade! Welcome to team green!
@HannesKoskiVhl @nvidia @TEAMEVGA sweet sweet notebook.
@Aperture_Games :( bad timing at least you have a great GPU though right?
@Tzeentch_kahles it would likely struggle to maintain a decent fps, you would need to upgrade.
@DaSchwoab @SrgntBallistic @NZXT @IntelUSA @IntelGaming it's a great build for sure :)
@belindaleegames @Razer @DXRacer love that setup!
@BraydosSKIIT That's a different department that handles that, you'll have to get in touch with our PR team.
@Coal_Dust_XIII @PlayOverwatch Oh Snap! Happy Birthday!
@jonnyesports @MSICanada if you eat it you will gain its power....but don't eat it lol. Grats on the new card!
@hypebros @nvidiashield hahaha if only that were true...
@Vertigo_Games: What is it like to experience the zombie apocalypse?Check out this Arizona Sunshine video by @SteamVR @NVIDIAGeForce htt
@PressingX it would overclock your brain too ;) still dangerous lol
@FalconNW @nvidia Hahaha truth! But it makes for a good photo 
@Mastrshok @nvidiathose are some tasty drinks! Not sure how much energy you get out of it but tastes good.
@Consti2tion hmm that does sound good though but maybe not for an energy drink.
@Alvahoeski  unfortunately not but we're giving one can away on Instagram right now along with GPUs. 
@rsn_gamer probably never, but winning a 960 is better than winning nothing
@Ifunny_Member @nvidia thanks! Right back at you 
@James25Jones truth! Maybe a little too dedicated but we had fun with it for sure 
@scar3crowdotcom Gross...but interesting 
@hypebros @nvidia that's what's up! 
@smoothnomad we might be able to do that. Keep an eye out for a post on our Instagram account 
You might have realized that GeForce GTX ENERGY wasn't quite real, but if it was would you buy one?
@JohnMichaelG5 @nvidiashield @htcvive can't take it off otherwise you leave the VR space, must maintain immersion ;)
@Panic4ttacks probably too much, but the ride will be worth it!
@typingloudly follow the GeForce Instagram account, we might be giving one away this weekend :)
@tababuuyy did you sign up to win a GeForce GTX 980 Ti though?
@MrFredsLP were you able to roll back to a previous driver and did that resolve the issue?
@TwoThirdsGod Awesome! Definitely share a picture of the final product with us!
@Tacolistic there's a known issue with that that we are looking into right now. Try uninstalling and reinstalling GFE.
@noonegvesashit have you already tried uninstalling the driver and reinstalling it?
@DefinitelyLinus unfortunately you are unable to exchange codes from one game for a different one.
@Gorbles that definitely shouldn be happening have you contacted support yet they might be able to investigate the issue and provide a fix
@olapman @MicrosoftHelps @nvidia what is it that you're trying to get help with?
@Joekingstan apologies for the inconvenience, we'll send this issue to our support team and have them look into this issue.
@daltonmachadov the 980M doesn't meet the minimum specs, though you could still run VR titles it might not be a great experience.
@jfclifford the link to win a VR Ready GPU? It seems to be working now.
@thedabca depends on the type of partnership you'd be interested in. Sent you a DM for more information.
@DigitalAmir @oculus :( Sorry totally not trying to troll.
@TheKingC97 @nvidia Nice! Congrats on the new GPU!
@_S1NN3D_ sorry that happened, thanks for reaching out to us about it we'll go ahead and investigate the issue.
@_S1NN3D_ is this with the latest driver 364.72?
@SrgntBallistic that's when you just put some headphones on and game all day and night to ignore that lol
@yonibenoni @TheDivisionGame you don't need to own it to enter. You just visit the site and create a gif using what is already there :)
@ryanl_ball @oculus There you go! Be sure to share a pic of your new GPU with us when it comes in :)
@Maarten_vd_v Nice! when you're ready for an upgrade you should easily be able to get a new GPU that is VR ready :)
@Squizdoo @oculus awww yes! You're definitely ready
@Lopez74Jara @oculus not going to lie, this is a little awkward lol
@Grahame_Wright @oculus the 970 can handle it, but totally understand if you just bought the 960 :)
@imhobson @oculus IGN had a deal posted for an EVGA 980Ti for 20% off and free shipping if that helps :)
@Lopez74Jara @oculus your gif game is on point! Love this one!
@EsileJoy @oculus i dont think that's a real video card used for this photo so maybe? lol ;)
@cra5hd0wn @marzplays @oculus @ADR1FTTheGame agreed :)
@imadous @EpicGames @UnrealEngine @Paragon should run well with a 960.
@Phil_Vass @EpicGames @UnrealEngine @Paragon no news yet, but could be soon. Keep an eye out for future updates.
@SirGreg_Snow @AssistantNick the newest drivers should be safe to download as it resolved the issues it had previously.
@MatsuNightfall there is a fringe case issue we've seen with this but you can either roll back the drivers or contact support for help :(
@overthemoonink @TEAMEVGA Good luck! We believe in you! let us know how it turns out :)
@ExplodingWindow @nvidia no worries we totally understand.
@Ttpojuu try uninstalling GFE and reinstalling it or using GFE beta if you have the non-beta version.
@ExplodingWindow @nvidia we're aware of this issue and hope to have a resolution for this very soon.
@MeatheadMilitia @nvidia I guess the community has spoken ;) DM us if you need some help with selecting a monitor :)
@PinkRubellite @EpicGames @UnrealEngine @Paragon Sounds like a plan :)
@TheNaomiRed hard to say, depends on various factors. Should last years though. Contact support if you're running into issues with it now.
@nigges_ Could be on their end. Some had the same issue when the promotion first started but they were able to resolve it.
@Mexican_Sushi_ @nvidia Hilarious! Clearly that car is from the future!
@sauli_Gako @Cloud9gg @nvidia @Twitch :( sorry there will be more chances to win a GPU, just gotta keep an eye out for it :)
@VVancalbergh @TheDivisionGame DM us when you get a chance we'll see what we can do for you.
@nigges_ Are talking about the initial redemption on the GeForce site or after you get the other code?
@PinkRubellite @Phil_Vass @EpicGames @UnrealEngine @Paragon We've played it in the office and had a lot of fun playing it.
@Nioubis Believe this was a giveaway only for those who were attending GDC.
@BeefSupremex @ASUS_ROG Awww yes!! What are you upgrading from?

@BlueHeelerKY Can't wait to see the finished product. Be sure to share a pic with us when it's done!
@FibroJedi @nvidia are you using GeForce Experience to update the driver?

@SniperX1989 @TEAMEVGA Oh snap! That's a great upgrade! Enjoy the new GPU!
@sirjaydee @nvidiacc We'll look into this issue. In the mean time have you tried downloading GFE Beta, that could resolve this issue.

@Northlander74 @nvidia This happens occasionally, typically you will be able to connect after a short period of time.
@king_stivan have you downloaded the latest driver? It should resolve this issue. We'll DM you to see if we can help.
@michaelpearson2 hmm ok, we'll send you a DM real quick to see if we can find out how to resolve this.
@TheRealFeey1 Are you using GeForce Experience to install the update?
@StormStep we might be able to find something. We'll DM you :)
@jczambrano1984 the driver is the same as the beta driver released earlier but is now WHQL certified.
@rekzai @nvidia Great! Please let us know if you run into any issues.
@jczambrano1984 This driver should resolve the issues from the previous driver.
@timrosco that's not good. We'll send you a DM to see if we can figure out what's going on.
@Jimbo_Wim @nvidia You're welcome. Please let us know if you run into any issues.
@ybwinner This driver should not cause the same issues as the previous one. Feel free to send us a DM if you run into any issues.
@therealproteus Yes, this driver should resolve the issues from the previous driver.
@NaNa_K_619 you're still experiencing the same issues as with the previous driver?
@geevaveeri We found an issue with the installer with the last driver, this update fixes that issue - you should be good to go.
@100prophet100 @nvidia we'll be sending you a DM to see if we can help you out.
@black24ghost we'd be happy to help you out as best as we can, but unfortunately our social team aren't engineers. :)
@TruBlu_3 @TEAMEVGA Thanks for entering! Good Luck!
@kim_jong_skillz @nvidia We'll send you a DM shortly and see what we can do for you.
@JonathanXnn @PellyNV :( We'll send you a DM see if we can help you out.
@Aaronmack99 No time table right now, however you can chose to not install the driver or try "Custom-Clean Install" instead of "Express".
@StillFunkyB @pcper We're still investigating this, if you install the new driver using "Custom-Clean Install" that could resolve the issue
@XanderTwinblade Have you uninstalled the driver and installed a previous one? That should be a temporary fix.
@STAR1ON87 Yes you can rollback to previous drivers as a temporary fix. Using Custom-Clean Install could also resolve the issue.
@shuu_37 It doesn't boot at all? Can you get it to the bios at least?
@timcancio @thebrendini can you send us a DM? We'll see if we can help resolve the issue for you. Thanks
@RektEmm can you DM us real quick? We'll see what we can do for you.
@DansoVegaz good to hear you were able to rollback the driver, we're working hard on resolving the issue.
@Caesar576 @TEAMEVGA @htcvive Awesome! Be sure to send us a pic of it when you get it in!
@Stephxx93 @shadowr1ku contact the retailer where you purchased, they should be able to assist you with getting a code.
@ThePengwn most issues that we've seen so far come from dual monitor setups, but we are continuing to investigate the issue.
. @MasonButters yes. You can do this or you can use one monitor during the driver installation and reconnect the other once completed.
@Sigtric @TheDivisionGame We'll send you a DM real quick to see if we can resolve the issue for you.
@Kaelaris @NVIDIAGeForce it is our pleasure ;) We enjoyed your work at IEM. Keep on rocking!
@RussellWick unfortunately we can't give out GPUs like that lol but keep an eye out for future contests, might have a chance to win one! :)
@TheManicGeek @SrgntBallistic @TEAMEVGA That's awesome! Congrats on the new GPU!
@Tedstar0125 That's no goodat all :( get in touch with our support team if you need anything, hope the next one turns out better.

@stiflercosmin @nvidia Grats on the new GPU! We might have something we can send you. DM us when you get a chance :)
@ColtonDalmau That definitely shouldn't be happening. What OS and GPU are you using so we can try to identify the issue?
@TheKing_OSAMA hmm ok. What OS and GPU are you using? And have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver?
@SOskillz7 can you send us a DM when you get a chance? Thanks!
@TheKing_OSAMA @FarCrygame @GearsofWar What kind of issues are you running into?
@Shawnf77 @nvidia awesome rig! Thanks for sharing it with us
@felipegus @htcvive it's definitely an investment but worth it if you can save up for it :)
@kalllium sorry you're running into that issue. What GPU and OS are you using so we can send this information to our support team.
@burritomafia @htcvive Don't think it would be possible to deliver the type of VR experience you would want if it was $250 :)
@melvintje1991 Nothing to announce yet but we continue to improve and refine our drivers, like we always have.
@hypebros @nvidia someone should be reaching out to you soon :)
@Brian_Easty @htcvive That's awesome! Enjoy living in the VR world and remember you still need to eat in real life. VR food doesn't count ;)
@RyanDracula @htcvive Still should be able to pre-order it, at least within the US.
@ArkAngelShaun are you excited to use the Oculus? Have you tried VR before?
@tylerwendt11 what type of issues are running into with ShadowPlay?
@jjweaver @nvidia :( there will always be more giveaways, but if you need help deciding what GPU to get next let us know we can def help out
@ColtonDalmau what version of GFE are you using? The beta?
@GordonVanDyke That's awesome! We definitely approve. Hope you're enjoying your new GPU!
@MikeMantis we can definitely look into this. We are always working to optimize and improve the experience with ShadowPlay and GFE.
@Unlimtedpowa @VWAssassin the sound in @EAStarWars Battlefront is incredible especially for any #StarWars fan, hard to deny that.
@CallanLeslie Haha. We can't do that but we appreciate the thought! :D
@GordonVanDyke welcome to the team! Is that a Star Wars quilt? If so I think we need to see more of it :D
@nvidia: #gamers let's rock the #oscars we want to giveaway some cards for our fans.... Every 5k votes = #gpus SHARE!!!
@SF_Raycism Are you having issues redeeming the code on our redemption site?
@ThatRoadieDude think you know what we would say :) but out of curiosity what kind of longboard were you looking at?
@ThatRoadieDude: Should i buy a @NVIDIAGeForce gtx 970 or a new longboard?
@Attackturkey the promotion started on the 17th, so if you purchased it then you would qualify for the code depending on what GPU you got.
@TheOfficialSQB can you send us a DM so we can try to help you with this issue? Thanks!
@Moonah_301 @nvidiaNice! Grats on the new card! Enjoy building your new PC this weekend.
@solis190491 if you want to upgrade but don't want to spend too much, it would probably be better if you picked up a GTX 950.
@Toolguns @nvidia @tombraider Awesome! Universal has gotten better in the past few years. Playing tomb raider is a great way to end the day!
@Toolguns @nvidia that's awesome! Is that at the Universal CityWalk?
@Tjlnx97 @HPSupport @Steam_Support @nvidia Are you experiencing this same issue with other games as well?
@PalotesMason we selected winners and are going through an approval period at the moment. Hopefully will be ready to announce it soon.
@IncreXible @nvidiashield Yes, the SHIELD Android TV supports up to 4 controllers!
@TwoThirdsGod @budgie_buddy Awwww yeah, our favorite time is rebuild time! We expect glorious pictures when it's finished.
@BethesdaStudios: What does Weapon Debris add to Fallout 4 1.3 PC Update? Watch @neogaf user GSY Miguel demolition demonstrationnhtt
@DaedalusOS @TEAMEVGA @IntelGaming @Corsair @ASUS_ROGUK We approve! Thanks for sharing this awesome pic with us!
@portillodesign we suggest contacting the retailer you purchased it from so they can assist you with getting you the code.
@BluFlarez @TEAMEVGA Awesome! What were you upgrading from?
@aianao @StevenSuptic awesome! Thanks for playing and entering the contest, good luck!
@lolToaster @StevenSuptic lol that's ok you can always try it again to improve your score :)
@SkyShark_X2 try using a different browser. We tested it on our end and it seemed to be working correctly with Chrome.
@YsaisMusic if you need a GPU now definitely go for it, otherwise Pascal will be out sometime in 2016. Unfortunately that's all we can say
@richeh88 thanks for the suggestion, we'll definitely pass that on to our devs!
@KaryssaKilljoys agreed! That GeForce snapback is worthy of a better camera ;)
@veachero Sorry, we don't have anything to announce right now
@llacero_pablo @nvidia we're always working hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible. Have you reached out to our support team yet?
@ImMunneY that is an awesome shirt to go with your amazing rig!
@madxn89 @TEAMEVGA As you should be, that is one amazing GPU! Hope you enjoy it!
@ItsKymbra thanks for coming by and hanging out with us and congrats on the shirts!
@OneWithFibro @tombraider @OriginPC it definitely is an amazing notebook. Be sure to share a pic with us when you get that upgrade! :)
@Boblikesdoritos you guys look great rocking those NVIDIA shirts! Your hair is just blown away by how awesome those shirts are!
@CI2AWMEI2AX No, anyone can come, it's just 21+ for drinking.
@CI2AWMEI2AX There will be, and we don't have a set time for the raffle.
@Rokkar @UplayUbisoft Can you send us a DM when you get a chance? Thanks!
@FelineNightwear @TheDivisionGame can you send us a DM when you get a chance? Thanks!
@KissMeImAGinger @nvidiacc sending you a DM soon, be sure to check that when you get a chance. Thanks!
@megadelgado @nvidiacc sending you a DM, be sure to check that when you can. Thanks!
@khemvall @nvidia can you send us a DM so we can assist you?
@MirrorsPotato can you send us a DM so we can assist you?
@NudsRharry that's bad timing. Maybe next year you'll be around to participate :)
@GuNStArHeRo212 Unfortunately there are no more codes available at this time.
@ScottyG14 That definitely shouldn't be happening every time like that. Going forward we suggest updating the driver outside of GFE.
@Drewwilliams100 @TEAMEVGA Grats on the new GPU! Be sure to post a picture of the final build!
@JR_Warlock No problem! Glad we were able to resolve it for you.
@majeansson Unfortunately not from our store; however you should be able to find it through a Swedish retailer.
@GamrInsanity We aren't doing the Golden Ticket hunts after today, but we will have other opportunities to get stuff.
@HoldenMyD Today is our last day, but there will be other opportunities to win during PAX South.
@TheRevPlays @TheDivisionGame We hope you enjoy!
@Code_Helix No panel, but we will have a meetup on Saturday from 5-8pm at Ruth Chris Steakhouse. Feel free to stop by!
@Kona_the_beast @nvidia Thanks for letting us know, it's an issue we're aware of and are looking into.
@Big_Problems_ Entirely up to you, the hunt will still be on but will get increasingly more challenging...
@KingMerc1 Can you follow us so we can shoot you a DM?
PSA: We're experiencing heavy traffic to @TheDivisionGame Beta page and; are working to get things running smoothly. Thanks for your patience.
@RataxSniperKill The ticket is inside the white envelope, which is shaded by a tree.
@Adjmass01 We'll have other opportunities to get stuff during PAX South.
@Bread3rs We're experiencing heavy traffic on our sites, working to resolve it. Thanks for letting us know!
@atvcrash You can go, but you'll get a stamp or wristband so you won't be able to drink.
@kpkloza No, we still have more than a few tickets left for today.
@MaxRoccat We're getting lots of traffic to the site, looking into it now.
@xtianp We're experiencing heavy traffic, we're looking into fixing things as quickly as we can.
@commander103 We think so, but we can't be sure. Depends on how quickly people find the last ticket.
@073M1KE We're experiencing some heavy traffic right now, keep trying!
@Iuccas Thanks for sharing, it's something we're aware of and are looking into.
@Kangenmaster @tombraider We hire tiny wizards to live in GPUs, they cast spells that developers write, and; that's how pretty games are made.
@Danezkii You never know where gold tickets might show up...
@Mr_Velocity1577 It's something we're aware of and looking into, thanks for letting us know.
@t_barrington Awesome to hear. What's your favorite game on @NVIDIASHIELD?
@Bulletearsfall First clue is coming soon, prepare thyself.
That's a wrap for the Golden Ticket hunt at #PAXSouth for today. Tune in tomorrow for more chances to hunt!
@commander103 yes, that's all of them for today. Stay tuned for tomorrow though!
@adlauren Nice! This has been the toughest Golden Ticket to find today, you could have had an advantage.
@atvcrash Not yet, but we're getting close to the end for today - tomorrow we start fresh again.
@AliAbbas_PS360 We're aware of this and we're looking into it. Thanks
@arcanekiten You never know when and where Golden Tickets might show up...
@Devlin_B The Golden Ticket hunt won't go on all weekend, but you never know what could happen...
@atvcrash You'll just have to stay tuned and find out.
@AmeliaTalon Scary, we know. We believe in you though.
@LogyHD Yes, though we have another one going up shortly.
@TabzLlama actually, we did! It was awesome! See you at the next one?
@justskylarkin All of our legs will be gloriously buff by the end of PAX though!
@JunpeiShibayama @nvidia @KathiWelt @NVIDIA_DE We're aware of the issue and are looking into it.
@D3viousD3vil Thanks for letting us know, we're aware of the issue and are looking into it.
@narkata69 @nvidia @nvidiadeveloper Thanks for letting us know, we're looking into it.
@Walking_Corpse9 We're aware of the issue and are looking into it. Thanks for sharing!
@TDon379 Like we'd blow through all our goodies in one day.
@justskylarkin That's it! Just find a Golden Ticket hidden around San Antonio and follow the directions to claim your prize. Easy!
@thurman_carter that's more of a nuzzle but we'll allow it :)
@khaldx11 @GIGABYTE_USA @nvidia @nvidiaME @GIGABYTE_VGA It's Alive! Thanks for sharing the video with us! :)
@JR_Warlock that's not good. We'll send you a DM real quick and try to sort it out for you.
@Genekk86 the winners for the Radiation check contest have not be finalized or announced yet, but we hope to do that soon.
@LeightonPatt @nvidia As an alternative for now you can register with Manufacturer.
@LeightonPatt @nvidia That's interesting. We'll go ahead and take a look at it. Thanks for bringing this to our attention! :)
@KluntBumskrint that's strange. Thanks for pointing that out, we'll look into it. :)
@MissMeisterrr @Razer @NZXT @CRYORIG @msiUSA @DXRacer @IntelGaming @HyperX Looks great! Nice job!
@BraaiSteakhouse no set time frame for that, but keep an eye out for future announcements for a Game Ready Driver for The Division.
@Hidden_Cortex @SmokinDank5280 these were sent out randomly to GeForce Experience Beta users. If you use GFE Beta, check your email :)
@BSanbizzle unfortunately this went out to existing users only, but there could be a chance for more beta chances like this in the future.
@KeithPlaysPC @overbuiltgaming That does look amazing!
@TheTsel @TEAMEVGA @evgagaming @NZXT Grats on your first build! You're starting with an amazing GPU too! Share some pics when you're done!
@MissMeisterrr @ASTROGaming @NZXT @msiUSA @Razer @DXRacer @CRYORIG @IntelGaming Have Fun with your build and the GTX 970!
@nvidiashield @LoveLaughLeslie this is just too adorable!!
@adamstreets87 @nvidia @TheDivisionGame You're welcome! We're excited about the beta too!
@Mikalton_YT sorry about that. The registration page is temporarily offline but we're looking into it. Hopefully won't be offline for long.
@EddSayers @nvidia @Ubisoft @TheDivisionGame Hope you enjoy the beta!
@RobinWithTheD @nvidia @NVIDIA_DE Thank you for being an awesome fan!
@JoblessGarrett Still didn't work? That's not good. Send us a DM if you need more help, we'll see what we can do for you.
@JoblessGarrett that's no bueno. Are you still running into these issues?
@no_scope_killer Sad Face! All that matters is that you're back to gaming. Just make sure your dad knows to get an NVIDIA GPU next time :)
@SilentDroidd that shouldn't happen. Are you running the beta version of GeForce Experience or the Live version?
@GussamuelVideos If you already have a case and a hard drive then you should be able to do it. If not it would be a bit harder to pull off.
@STEEEEEEEEEEVEE a GTX 970 would be a great choice, it future proofs you a little plus gives you VR support if you are interested in that.
@STEEEEEEEEEEVEE What type of build are you going for? Top of the line? Budget? Something in the middle?
@ipond317 @TEAMEVGA @evgagaming @nvidia Grats on your new amazing GPU!
@Davyoordijk06 @NZXT @Corsair @ASUS @HyperX @intel wow you did a great job for your first PC build! Grats!
@flawless__gamer @Fallout @nvidia That's a great way to play it! Thank you for being an awesome fan!
@ColoradoGuy88 @ASPHIAXCaseMod Yup, it's a functioning PC!
@suhjamel @ASPHIAXCaseMod Slurms Mckenzie! He just wants to rest...
@cj1803cj You're welcome! We've definitely received a lot of requests to include multiple audio tracks hope to add that in the future.
@NabeelPrime That's not good at all. Have you tried uninstalling the latest driver and reverting back to the previous driver?
@ST3ALTHSE7EN Glad we could help! Thanks for your awesome support!
@Aklaba @nvidia All gamers with kids feel your pain, we'll see what we can do :)
@polyswi14 If you purchased a GPU during a promotional period you should receive a code, if not you can contact the retailer for assistance.
@Codizzle1985 We have not forgotten either. We've selected finalists and are awaiting approval. We hope to announce the winners soon!
@FCG_Fudwicks :( that's no good. Let us know if you need help on deciding what GPU to get!
@popsramsey can't promise anything but you can try to contact our support team to or Amazon to see if they can do anything for you.
@Joseph_George91 OH MAN!!! Grats on the new GPU!
@kierpanda @BlizzHeroes @PlayOverwatch Oh Snaps! Be sure to share that with us when you're done. Might have to give it a try :)
@kierpanda @BlizzHeroes This is pretty awesome!! Do you plans to make more Blizzard themed foods?
@JoshArataRP are you experiencing this issue with all games while running GFE?
@petritrebs The site lists the GPUs that we know could offer a great VR experience and that are readily available for purchase.
@onsoneonsine Assuming you already tried to uninstall and reinstall, try using the live version for now. We'll look into this issue.
@HighEindSquad is it happening for other games as well or just this one?
@KalifNimrod @nvidia @msiUSA @msitweets @BenQAmerica Grats on the new card! You have a very cool dad!
@teemu92fin I think you're gonna need a bigger boat...I mean shelf ;) Love the collection!

@ChadA109 Baby Groot! One of the best Funkos ever!
@billbooard Awesome collection and photo! Thanks for sharing a pic of your rig too!

@iMrSam :( Never too late to start a collection up!
@k3llycakes Spoken like a true bobblehead collector! We Approve!
@mkyend @txmrxdgers @NVIDIA_UK @nvidia This shirt was only available for a limited time to help raise money for charity.
@Epiccodtion Nice! As long as its an upgrade that's all that matters :)
@AvgJoe_Gamer @TEAMEVGA Nice! Grats on the new GPU!
@theDroid_real @txmrxdgers @NVIDIA_UK @nvidia This shirt was only available for a limited time to help raise money for charity.
@txmrxdgers @NVIDIA_UK @nvidia Awesome! The shirt looks great! Thanks for donating to a great cause!
@Sharmanize @SwiftyiRL @nvidia Ha! Not sure what is going on here but have a feeling that @nvidiashield has something to do with this :D
@PikaPowerPwnd As you should be :) congrats on the upgrade! Hope you're enjoying your new GPU!
@anTastico84 We're still working on this function and hope to make that available soon.
@ZigurG @BlizzHeroes We're currently working on going through the many entries to select winners. We hope to announce that soon.
@VinexNike Welcome to the team! Grats on your new GPU! We're sure you'll enjoy it :)
@Haze2K1 @BlackDesertNA @nvidia Great screenshots!
@FlukeWired @Corsair @ASUS_ROG @OriginPC @IntelUSA Awww :( sorry to hear that, at least this means you can have fun building a new PC right?
@KXNGSLXY Glad to hear you were able to figure it out :)
@TeutonicReign @msiUSA @msitweets thanks for being an awesome fan! Grats on your new gear!
@llama_sacred @andressergiox @NVIDIA_UK @nvidia @NVIDIAFrance @NVIDIA_ES @nvidiabrasil Looks amazing! Definitely has a tron look to it!
@ddamc18 did you get any redemption information from the retailer where you purchased the gpu?
@nukacolacub That looks really cool! We approve!
@MJFMortBanker not once did I care about their success... or claim that it bothers me. Go bank or some shit.
@MJFMortBanker I mean... I sure as fuck don't.And you're still here, contesting that I fuckin should or something.
@MJFMortBanker great! Maybe they can buy some talent.
@ryancusimano coz the thing came with stickers. So I put a sticker on it
@myrissajade was more of a fact. Move along, and take your class with you.
@myrissajadeI had a prime. All you're likely to ever have is a snapchat account and probably syphilis. What now.
@myrissajade sell em. See if you make enough to buy a brain.
@JESSSMELL0 well, since the bars been lowered to all hell, doesnt seem like an impossibility. glhf
@DJProperJB @TheChainsmokers coz theyre fuckin gimps. gimps gunna gimp.
a rather large box has arrived at my front door. can it be? is it...?
@SaiAndreAlfaro NUMEROUS ARTICLES YOU SAY?WELL THEY MUST BE RIGHT THEN.
@brograph nah, it works baking an image texture... it just blows that you can directly plug in the noise shader.
TIL noise shaders wont animate cycleswith Octane.
man, im going back to bed. im way too jetlagged or something. which is messed up, because i never really get jetlagged.
@jessskn yeah. a couple donuts here and there. no TV or car yet.
@kaskade its like accidentally passing on herpes.
@Resolume would be nice if you could import geometry and camera data into the advanced mapping stuff in Avenue :
And now that I did what I came to LA to do, I gotta run back home and finish programming Le show
But what actually happened, is that we both walked right past each other thinking about how much we look like twin brothers of other people.
and now that the content is ready to get compiled... i have to fly to LA in like 2 hours. figures.
when this is done... i should to look into engineering little 6 or 8 inch LED cubes so you can buy one and put it on your desk. :D
@JoshuaDavis thnks... just dicking around with some geo.
@anupamofficial @JoshuaDavis @Vimeo josh did. and i tweaked it
@loc_ops just want an overview of my lan starting from my main router to see what the hell (and why) is being such a pig on my LAN
any techs out there reccomend any good realtime-ish LAN network monitors?
@GOttaviani will totally give you a call if i need a usb key insertted. for now, ill leave the neve installation to neve people.
@stevenemersonuk well.... all this shits so new... so, lots of finagling.
@stevenemersonuk @maxon3d yeah... thats funny :)
@MagmaExpressBox does the 3600-10 have room in there for a mobo / hd? or do you have to run the pcie to another box / host?
@brograph well scene dependant... it's not so much the time. Still 4s a frame, but iterations in the thousands
@halcy its for number crunching. not minecraft at 8k.
"One day, you watch and see, one day, im gunna be this companies licensing manager!" -said nobody, ever.
@adambromell oh I'm famil with the game... that's crazy!
@mu55v because i want to. you're not my boss. so stop whinging.
just wrapped up an awesome session / interview thing with the @brograph guys... what an awesome community :D
@zanstex diffuse is dark grey to catch light... green is a blackbody emissive , using a gradient shader.
@jnj255 look at all these fucking press vultures.
well. @Dudeeberg showing up to a production with video walls / and an LED cube without any video content would be generally frowned upon.
@RANCHComputing oh hey, you guys support octane?
@charlieXwallace oh word! grab my email from clay and sign my ass up!
@beeple i was actually using this pretty basic ass free one called proc3dure
im going to name the next big thing in a past tense so i don't look like such a fucking idiot when i bring it up in conversation 4 years on.
@GRIMECRAFT can't do a fuckin thing without some weird shit coming out of left field.
@Arclegger @GRIMECRAFT or just REALLY FUCKING COPYABLE.
@Arclegger @GRIMECRAFT WELL FUCK ME IF EVERYONES COPYING HIM THEN HE MUST BE FUCKIN GREAT
i fucking hate peddlers of things.just fuckin... "be"
@GRIMECRAFT why dont you just go full tilt VCA rendering and broadcast a a live stereo h.24 video feed to spectators? fuck a gaming card.
@GRIMECRAFT nothing wrong with baking AO. but if i see another hot pink bloom swooshy trail zip across my FOV im going to break shit
@GRIMECRAFT you gotta get a few hardcore AAA UE guys on the optimization and shaders. feels like a miami vice epileptic eyefuck atm.
@GRIMECRAFT yeah. seems like its been stuck in beta for years.
maybe the next round of content will be chasing meowingtons around with the red. maybe some green screen
@GRIMECRAFT well i do own the label and all that. i dont know. like 30 people fuckin work there and i only know like 5 of em.
@GRIMECRAFT you just said you had a meeting with tiff... im joel.
@GRIMECRAFT well, if i dont already know now... then i probably wont in a week.
@GRIMECRAFT still news to me. i live in canada. youre probably going to our office.
@GRIMECRAFT UE. already got something in the works. but im not about to unload some 1/2 assed thing. youll see.
@GRIMECRAFT yeah, cant wait to tie this into an engine.
@lenniedofkes it would be warped funny on the cube... it would have to get remapped in realtime. doable for sure.
@tbiird716 and this makes you exempt from being stupid on social media somehow...?
@JohnnyFerland nah. mebbe later. grill gets home soon anyway
@tbiird716 with as much free time as you probably have, i wouldn't put it past you.
@tbiird716 @IsThereJustus @SneakyAdmawilling to bet he seems to think 400 is some incredible feat.
first rule of night time ATV'ing club is don't tell grill about night time ATV'ing club.
@V3R1FY @LinusTech yeah, got the Dragon... no weapon here tho :(
i think "i need help" was an application form for a new web dev
"yeah, its not us... are you sure googles chrome isnt all fucked up and way inferior to our obvious working thing?" @SoundCloud
@eyedesyn @beeple ha. ;)i think we have a mutual understanding of what compartmentalization is.
@eyedesyn loL!well, without teachers, we'd all be fucked. :D thanks for helping!
@maskboy700 i dont even have one of those hoodies yet :(
@grizcreative @ubnt theyre great eh? rigged up the house with a couple... can finally breathe around here.
@iamelycin tho I really should set up a box for this
@iamelycin thanks. 95.250.255.237 trying to telnet
Okay. Time for a nap. Team nosleep over here is losing touch with reality.
@notch holy shit, its an actual thing... that's crazy.... right up there with competitive vaping. lol
@LaidbackLuke well, in all fairness... i totally told him to shut the fuck up. people don't listen to me.
oh man... he shoulda just shutted the fuck up. i told em! didnt i tell him?
@GARMIANI_ well... i guess. i mean... if you're going to do something... might as well do it right.
@glennmorrison dont act like its the most attention you've had all year. shut the fuck up and enjoy it. but shut the fuck up, mostly.
fine.that. to your face.shut the fuck up glen.@glennmorrison
well.. here goes nothin. doing a test pass at a 6300 frame long render.
@ErickWeber oh you didnt know deadmau5 is basically a Micheal Cassette cover band?
lol. my internet is terrible. ice rain. completely covered my tower. this could be a good thing... workmode.
.@JoshuaDavis and @nvidia are SERIOUSLY pulling through for me today. I love my tech family.
@ErickWeber but you know whats really fucked up? his remix of Raise Your Weapon is technically closer to ghost in the machine.
@ErickWeber im also fairly certain every Glenn Morrison track isnt Glenn Morrison.
@ErickWeberand anything else i can not give a fuck about tonight? coz i gotta install an Iray lisc server....
@ErickWeberand or the vocal topline of Ghosts and stuff that "is a complete rip off" of Chris Isaak's wicked game too i suppose.
@ErickWeber yes. i know the track, we release his music on our label as well.
@Etrain90 I didn't play I remember at sxsw. You're listening to a different set. Next time try attending an event.
RIGHT! just started playing around with @nvidia IRay.... love the insanely fast live IPR on it!
@lilvvvvv that is a very uneducated president you just elected.
@techAU well duh. thats whats running on the local machine. im talkin cloud.
any cloud rendering systems you guys know of that lets up upload .orbx? maybe i can find one of those.?
i really need to get my network rendering game on.
doing a low res test of gula sequence, then maybe ill let a full blown PMC render overnight
@C418 yeah. i mean... whatever suite is whatever. Octane Render FTMFW tho
@JlackBesus work on that education system then. i dunno.
@JustinTrudeau: To those fleeing persecution, terror and; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our stren
@Vitalize_US well makes me wonder why you guys have the worlds only terrorism problem
@Vitalize_US and you think a "ban on everything muslim.. coz hey, ya newver know" isn't idiotic or anything.
anyways... im just bummed out is all. #canadasecond ?
STFU. CELEBRITIES AND ENTERTAINERS SHOULD FUCKIN STAY OUTTA POLITICS! (cept our president)
Great. Trump banning immigrants. Guess you better send Melania back too.
@cbentleymusic you cant. lol. i did unreasonable things for this one.
@audioalgorithms go ahead. my phone right here. use your magic ultrasound and get flappybird to tell me your masterplan.
@audioalgorithms im starting to think you're actually full of shit.
@audioalgorithms you can't hijack 1,000 phones via ultrasound just like you cant duct tape a cat to a jet engine.
@audioalgorithms because i have 180,000 watts of fuck off PA to deliver a message.
@audioalgorithms i said it was vague. not generic.
@JensHainbuch yeah.... 3 cents a frame is really expensive.
seriously, if i didnt catch that output, i would have wasted a LOT of time. LOL
was starting a render that was 7200 frames long, got on a conf call to show a dude... realized i had wrong output res. WHAT A SAVE
i do plan on working on new music soon tho... ive just been saving myself for this new console really. taking a breather.
@shelbyholliday @cvpayne well, from my endpoint, i'd consider it an investment of sorts... just more on the junk-bond side.
@shelbeerrs can you get through a whole 24 hours without stealing a quote?
@shelbeerrs this age of EDM? Did we just time travel?
now i gotta match a 35mm lens to my render camera..... and hilarity should ensue.
i could either print out a mask overlay and tape it on the LCD... or just use an HDMI out and overlay elsewhere i suppose.
any Red / Epic / Dragon users out there know if you can use a png as a custom overlay for shooting? couldn't find anything online :(
@doot0 you cant upload raw image data to flikr knob.
gunna take a little bit... each jpg export ended up being 22mb each shot. lel. hi res or go home i guess.
oh whoops... accidentally uploaded the unprocessed ones.LOL... ill fix it when i do the other uploads.
@rosemarysiemens nobody with a fucking brain. thats who.
@MKBHD dat 5D SR.... such a wise move getting this for the safari. gotta travel light!
@Hasnaat_ how many f1.2 wide angle lenses do you know of?
@AymanSully wrong. longer exposure is more blur.stars move you know.
Thank you @giraffe_manor for the awesome stay! Off to our next destination!
@SusanLUCKYWong just visiting... taking in some safari and culture....this time. ;) I'll come back!
@CapitalFMKenya thank you! beautiful place you got here!
Taking lots of pictures! I'll upload em somewhere nightly. :)
So we've arrived at Girrafe Manor... it's late, but giraffes are nightowls apparently. We have breakfast with em tomorrow.
@930Club oh! You guys still have shirts left? I can't find mine :(

@SnowDa_ReClaima unlike the beautiful tapestry of sounds that you prefer that just come alive and cure cancer. GO I HATE RADIOHEAD FANS.
@SnowDa_ReClaima *gotten. and yes, i accept most major credit-cards and bitcoin.
@SnowDa_ReClaima what the fuck even are you? get back inside your pokeball and just shut the fuck up.
@KenThilhorn ill wear a condom. but i suggest you bring lube. your choice.
@KenThilhorn well.. when they are... i wish you, and the young lad you so furiously jerked off, a speedy recovery.
@KenThilhorn are your little girly wrists broken?
@zayahp speaking of whack ass mix, Avid desks dont come with opinions. go discreet, then we'll have a chat.
@The1stKruse hahaha i wasnt trying to be mean, just funny... he accidently forgot to kill the mic feed while my monitors were blasting in it
@squnto @lilyachty im okay with it. i just hate it when my passive aggressive jokes backfire all to hell. semi-mad.
@TrulyBoMason well... this could be a long conversation... but im happy to offer some advice?
@JeradBowes you can still get those carts online right?
@JeradBowes well... then i have to find an LSD cart too.
@ogiacomotto been following you for the longest time... you've really shaped up! great stuff :)
@ahmedraxon much obliged. Its an amaazing track. really.
@TrulyBoMason thats commendable for sure... but why cali?
@_Santiago23_ i personally expected them to cry like little school girls. Achievement unlocked.
@wessicaaaa I bet! And thankfully I wasn't in the elevator you apparently got gangbanged in.
@spaceghostkeith #gottemcoach #goodone #wow #burn #cool
@JMNH_17 you tell me? it was never a career. those are what people call hobbies.
@spaceghostkeith dont like it? dont fucking come at me. If i wasn't me, i'd probably not bother. but i can't stop them. so what can i do.
@Donald2theG and you're a nobody tweeting at me with a nobody account. irony.
@Donald2theG what the fuck does that mean? to what does this RANDOM AS FUCK declaration pertain to? just stop already.
@Donald2theG because they're up in my fucking business. Is this really hard to follow or something?
@Donald2theG ? what business?i own the fucking business.
@NoJakeHere*fan-base, one word. Use a hyphen. Bit of a "PRO-TIP" for you there when you make it to grade 6.
@Zedd ;) ill come visit soon. i still want to see this dual firepit thing.
gnight! gotta rest up and taking my tired and busted self to Puerto Rico to play music i like at a place people will be at.
@NoJakeHere im 36. not too clear on what a crack hear is? is this a phil collins joke us young people aren't supposed to get?
@NoJakeHere hi, im jake. i am 16 year old. i have been listening to sick EDM for 4 months now.
@Zedd @DouglasDiLillo well, upon the 129874th listen... i am kinda with doug on this one. i can own that, and move on.
i can deal with tears over "ghost n struff" vs. "alone" ... but you cant fucking sit there and say Maceo Plex's Solar Detroit is "weak fam"
as for the REST of you.... thank you for letting me play what i love, and know that i put a lot of consideration into that. :D
alternatively.... you could... just stay the fuck home and realize, not guess, that i dont give a fuck. you bunch of fucking crybabies.
apologies to everyone to had to listen to actual techno. next time i will playlil yachty vocals over dope trap beets for you and your fam
jeez, how many worlds do i have to roll in terraria just to get a f'n demon altar nearby? been 30 mins now...
Alright. Packing it up. Seeya shortly Dallas... then immediately hauling ass to chicos. I mean El Paso.
@Tesla_369 yeah, you're right. We shoulda got you to do it, I think a squeaky 13 year old female vocal would have been MUCH better.
@JhuanMoreTime @TIDALHiFi they probably should have phrased that better.
@feedme nope. I kinda made a point to show up 5 mins before my set. THIS IS HOW WE LEARN.
@FiyaBear_ oh they change. Just not always for the better.
electronic music today is just an empty shill of whatever the fuck survived the 90's.BUT ITS ALL GOOD FAM. POSITIVE VIBES THO, sick drops
@sleepyjeckie coming out of excitement... staying for chicos.
@Nebuphon @wiknow2but still what? What if we were working on something for 6 years, and we couldn't own it so some "little buis" does?
@Nebuphon @wiknow2 and you know it's unrelated to my industry?
@shadowmelody1but you hardly know the context. So... go on.
@L3TT3RSNUMB3RS alright then, I guess I'll just ignore you? I'm not sure what you want.
@L3TT3RSNUMB3RS then I suppose my casual 2 cents shouldn't matter much either... because I too, am an individual.
@L3TT3RSNUMB3RS would you like an aggressive aggressive one?
@KingFlyKOTD oh god... everyone's in on this game huh? I haven't even tried it!
Aaand meowingtons comin in hot with the MVP before the close of 2016. Damn! Get it!
@L3TT3RSNUMB3RS pedantic. On twitter. How does that work?
@CRAZEARONI @bleepbloopbass what gets me tho, is that's like 80% of their customer base
I have this new obsession with @Dickies pants. Jeans are so 2016.
@UnleashedJack Eric's great tho... I don't think I could add much to what he already does.
@koochai @ThisIsAPIaudio well... look at that. I had no idea. I'll take a few of those strip modules tho...
@SentrikMusic because API doesnt make a console... to start
@RafachafaEliop behind what? Shit 15 year olds listen to? Yes I'm really behind then. The fuck do you want?
@RafachafaEliop I don't know why the fuck that is either.
oh... found it. SIlent Picture, then it was a silent picture remake with a vocal, then it was blood for the bloodgoat, THEN let go. wow.
@DJYodaUK you have no idea how much i love foundsound shit. this is gold.
aaaand i lost the project files for that "let go" track... where the fuck did i put all this shit?
@beardyman you had me at Fish Heads. man.... why doesnt anyone do boutique shit like this anymore?fucking music is braindead as fuck.
@beardyman its fucking awesome! maann... i love shit like this. So many foundsounds.... fuck.
@scrwbl8 yeah... i was wondering about that... maybe take it back and get an RME fireface or something more practical?
@scrwbl8 nice nice... why the raydat tho? Going to ADAT / optical?
Probably going to start my next album in late Jan. The Neve desk should be in by then, so... might as well wait for quality.
@BFuentes11 what does liking anyones shit i dont like do for anyone? go to bed.
@v_ct_r_jr what interaction? I'm playing and getting the fuck out to El Paso. Calm down drama queen.
The Nye shows are gunna be dope! Cube isn't ready yet :( but, bringing in some great edits and new music :)

brb. sacrificing a goat, drinking chicken blood, diner with Baal at 9 then a secret gvt Illuminati meeting. happy holidays!
@FridgeCheese well, you sir have won my internet for the day.
@aTinyRabbit brb, scrubbing my eyeballs with steel wool.
@finnof300 oh I wasn't aware a different group of denizens voted for the same shit. MY BAD. Now go away. I'm busy
@finnof300 America also voted in trump. Your argument is invalid. -a Canadian guy.
@Langatang27 well, that's just like, your opinion, man.
Being lazy right now, but two new @ShottyHorroh tracks on the way. Much hype.
@TheGwidKnight you actually got that all backwards.
blocking me was the most creative and original thing you've done. keep up the great work. @chainsmokers
@iAustinLucas its been 8760 hours. and in none of those hours, have you learned a fucking thing. go away.
@iAustinLucas uh... you mean, you were randomly selected for a verbal beatdown. yeah. so iconic.
like.. i want to play some rocketleague, but im finally rising star, steve's not around, and i dont wanna pair up with some random scrub. :(
@ericprydz THIS JUST IN: Eric lols... and YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HONEY BOO BOO LOOKS LIKE NOW... CLICK HERE FOR MORE
@PeteRock haha :) lets get together sometime and get some shit done!
@SachsElliot doesn't it suck when people post your personal shit, even tho its public info, for everyone to see? yeah. i hear ya.
@beeple getting back on my c4d game... finally took the bait and sprung for r18
@AndiDurrant @SteveAngello yeah... elliot sachs drove that pile of shit into a deeper pile of shit.
i should call him up and offer him hot leads on clickbait.
@TheLive_IQBAL write a post about it. fuckin crybaby.
@TheLive_IQBAL don't leave your shit laying around the internet then?
TIL: A single pixels width... according to scalar quantization for a 1920 width image is 0.00052083333
@RedGiantNews life. the universe. everything. what does it all mean? but mostly, some great collaborative ideas im cookin up!
@RedGiantNews hey. we should talk bout somethin!
@TigerJeetSingh_: What a great #MiracleOnMain thank you to everyone that came out and helped and donated this morning!! #toydrive #Milto
@JordanOplinger that looks like it would drive me insane
was it just me? or was there away to import a small video into ableton and see it in a window while you edited?
"Donald Trump takes aim at US intelligence" - i see what you did there CNN.
@macoyen ableton, or even a demo copy of ableton could easily suffice... but it translates well to any other DAW tbh
@OfficialRezz true. im probably just getting old. im up at 6am feeling quite refreshed.in bed by 8pm tho.
@DiscoverMono okay thats just mean. :( im touring :(
@DiscoverMono in case anyone ever wanted to know what a truckload of win looked like...
Say, that's a nice venue you got there... it'd be a shame if someone added another date. ;)
@PeteRock dig snowcone i see? that's rad. one of my favs.
@kennytheblooper you should probably take your own advice on regarding WHAT MATTERS.
@kennytheblooper because your question is stupid as fuck and you should probably take some time to re-evalute your priorities.
@kennytheblooper is that really shit you wonder about? sad.
@edcazfam i use 4 switch craft TT bays. million times easier. oldschool... but thats analog for you.
@DavidVonderhaar does it translate well in the studio there? really curious... only ref'd it in like 2 spots.
NYC! both nights on the tour have sold out so another two for ya. march 31st and april 1st on sale this friday at noon.
.@DroneRaceLeaguethanks for having me! and thanks for the tips :D

@DroneRaceLeague i got it here... and a taranis... ready to rock?
whelp... tickets are kinda goin... so were adding even more shows in a row... added some extra dates in seattle and oakland.
@jonogrant coz that shit never gets obsolete... like on board features and digital routing and all that crap. changes by the year
@jonogrant yeah... i guess different flavors for everyone. i went with the neve for the simplicity / discreet channelstuffs.
well... its time.im going to redo the front desk in my studio and configure a @Rupert_Neve 5088 as a console. stuffs bout to get serious
anyway, im going to bed. here's hoping i dont wind up on some boring fishing trip with Brendan Fraser or that annoying sidekick dude.
also, it's Sunday... if you don't have a lot of shit going on, go out and support your local community, even if just a tiny bit.
.@JustinTrudeaucoffee run next time you're in the neighborhood?would be fun!
@David3452 i just call him that so i don't have to pay him.

can't say that shit like that doesn't make me seriously glad to away from that crap and be an independent label thanks to my fans. #music
this actually happened.having exhausted nearly all efforts in the electronic music business, they've been reduced to this?
@NRGgg eyoooo!!!! good luck fellas! get them air drags in :D
Watching 5 minutes of bork memes should cleanse my mental palette
I had a weird dream that the prime minister and Micheal Jackson came over and we went deer hunting.
@am17an ah yeah, forgot about that program... is there a way to render out avi/h24 with alpha transparency yet?
@RemiDSS but, you don't know what you're talking about.(or know how to talk, can't decide on either)
kinda excited to launch my next little pet project album, hopefully Feb "stuff i used to do" .. remastered tunes from 98-2007
#1 album in iTunes dance, and #9 overall?what is this devil magic?
@LikeAGentlemen you're fucking stupid, actually.
thanks for all your kind words on the album.. means a lot. maybe i shouldn't be so critical of everything i do. i'm glad you enjoy it.
send me a link if you get bored and want to do a few... i should do a few sequences of fan created content :D
fun idea.... for all the pixel pushers and vertex herders out there... if you want to make some fun cube animations...
@MKBHD yeah, or installing it into the UI panel script foler instead of the root of the script folder... got it. LOL
@komocode yup that was it. i was one directory short.
@komocode nothin....is C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe After Effects CC 2017Support FilesScripts???right?
@MKBHD yeah. lol.just nothin showing up in "windows" menu... thought it might be a CC thing

@SchoolOfMotion hey joey, ever get that midi plugin to load in AE CC2015.3 ? seems she doesnt want to load :(

"Next, he happened upon a folder titled  PORN FOLDER. Lucky for him, it appeared to be empty."- trash read of the day
THE UBIQUITY GUY IS HERE THE UBIQUITY GUY IS HERE!!!!(runs around house flailing arms)
@EsaFung ah nice! we should picked you up... hindsights a bitch
matter of facr... we should do a fun livestream ill ustrating how to rip samples. lol... for educational purposes of course.
some of the samples you could lift from boney m would make a fucking seriously mean house track
b4-4....lyrical genius... "im gunna make you come tonight.... awkard pause.... over to my houuuuseee"
@SLawnchairs yeaaaaahhh but.... when a political leader dies (discord aside) theres ways to acknowledge that as a presi.. nevermind
Just when people thought my twitter account was a complete trainwreck...
Driving down my street I see this house all Xmas lights out and lit... thinking what losers... pull in to realize it's actually my house. :(
@filterfreq i dont think i know anyone who has a custom daw.
@Northern_GG @RocketLeague drop in for a stream sometime! :D
@gianlucoso never met em. super talented dude tho
@WRRPhoto I think so. I think it really covered a lot on getting setup as an electronic music maker ;)
@SkrillexnDiplo so you have zero reason. Ok. Makes sense.
@SkrillexnDiplo why is that? Any particular reason? Elaborate.
@C418 @notch have you never fucked with it?its like Kyma... ish.
@C418 @notch yeah it does. it's Buzz. lol... what i need to get back into is audiomulch.... that shit was whack
@C418 @notch no, the only real advantage to x64 in most DAWS is just memory handling and whatnot, i doubt buzz is heavy on that
@notch well if making music is the goal... somehow i feel like you'd be more at home with a tracker?
@notch in fact, working with epic on a few things and forced them to re-implement OSC and MIDI io in UE.
@notch well, make sure you check out OSC for control as well... LOADS more flexibility and cross platforming fun with it
@KN0WI7ALL i've done a few enjoyable things since then.
@GapoLah as opposed to normal music run through an oscilloscope?
just watched the entirety of my @masterclass ... turned out pretty great, actually. glad i shared as much as i did. :D
I figured it out. It was the heater thing in my garage.
...but what concerns me more is this weird as fuck humming in my house, which i cant seem to track down.
im just thankful that i got to have thanksgiving like a month ago.
@Starkillers sorry bro, I only specialize in shut-downs.
she hasn't even been there for like 3 hours and she already caught this massive lizard.
grill went to flordia for the weekend. im just staying here.
why did "independence day 2" make more than 4 dollars?
well, it turns out they still make switchcraft TT to DSUB bays.thank god for that
@Dzikiewicz they've been around longer than google. fyi
@MCGoldMine @backblaze a NAS at home is always good. backburner is a *just in case* coz, you never know really.
side note: backing up your shit to @backblaze is really inexpensive, i'd encourge my fellow producers to do it. nobody likes losing shit.
@GRIMECRAFT @backblaze well im not expecting any fires or floods this week. so, im okay with this.
and now im backing up the 7TB o crap onto @backblaze... What a save!rip bandwidth.
@backblaze 10,20, 400 a month. kinda dont care. backing up ones entire career is kinda ... priceless. just need it done. :D
@backblaze hmm... we should setup a call. might be best to deliver physically?
@backblaze yeah, seems i have like 7tb(ish) that could probably use an offsite backup
@OrczyMusic read the disclaimer / readme.txt included with the pack. it's pretty obvious.
@OrczyMusic this song does not feature me. please remove it from itunes. or we will.
@GRIMECRAFT yeah but only by 1.8x apparently... zfs life.
i have literally, just compiled / backed up / and filed 13 years worth of data.time to start a new catalog.
fuck. organizing the big dump from all the HD's to the new NAS, apparently ive written well over 550 tracks... not including remixes. damn.
@sforys92 @feedme either or works really, SPL tans designer / trans X / melda makes a good one, uhh... transient master from NI.. etc
@TheKid_RyRy oh, comments. how do those work? those mostly arbitrary things people spit out to fill the cloud with pointless data?
@TheKid_RyRy im just going to ask what im sure a few people are wondering:What the FUCK are you even talking about? include gifs.
@TheKid_RyRy allow me to retort:I have less then even twice the sound your asking us to.
@TheKid_RyRy i stream potential weekdays from 5pm to 7am.
@TheKid_RyRy ...show people i have....what?a cat?google it.
@feedme i dont think it was... lemme see if i can track it down.
@RJousse I didn't say anything to a DJ mag in France.
@RJousse oh, tell me more about how well versed you must be about the music industry.
I should just produce a whole album for @ShottyHorroh ... dudes so easy to work with.
@RJousse no. I was just wondering what the music you released sounded like.
whoa. randomly working on this new shotty track, and i found an old wav from 1998 that works so well. just need to transcribe it.
@GRIMECRAFT hey, it was some bleeding edge shit at the time.
@limetechnology can you force a cache dump? or change the time it does it?
Array Started-Sync / Data-Rebuild 47.2 % Dynamix webGui v2016.11.11GET GOOD ALREADY
just woke up wondering why tiestos adagio for strings is like 140 bpm... isn't that allegro?
maybe it's time... to just sit down, and work on this fabled "album i like" thing ive been wanting to do for the past 10 years.
this is seriously a love/hate thing happening here.But, a thing, nonetheless. and it's good to be doing things.
my favs on there are probably snowcone and whelk then. those i like. happy with those for sure.
i don't even like it. it was like... so fucking rushed / slapped together. but i mean... hey, if you like it i wanna like it too, just dont.
at least you dont have to sit here and endure me constantly peddling shit. buy this, out now, buy that, wahhh click here.
and of course huge thanks to @LinusTech for pointing my learning ass in the right direction. :D
aaand @limetechnology saves the day :)unraid FTW
yeah, i got my Storinator all setup and the terminal in / drives in... just need to go about mucking with the ZFS now.
@TigerJeetSingh_ good seeing you today! We'll be in touch! :)
@GamingAztec i too, can add numbers. VIVE on nasdaq only reached a high of 9 points. not 900.
@duPontREGISTRY oh NOOOOWWWW they go RWD.... *facepalm*

@Gold_Burg111 nothing really amazing about hard work. but ok. amazing then.
@II_l_ll i dont think they deliver mail to human trash receptacles such as yourself.
whats funny is we had that box setup like 2 months ago, i've just been lazy AF and didnt bother telling you. but hey, better late than never
hey. we got a new PO box... if you want to send me stuff that i can try my best to reply tonndeadmau5nPO Box 159nCampbellville, ONnL0P 1B0

@RubenRuben_ where did you find that image? link?
@thepacketrat @notdan @Jonqah ohm my god you guys are on fire.

leaked album  the work i did publicly, is now publicly available on public media services.
omg so pissed the album i produced entirely on live streams is leaked.
@Shaun_Frank atmos translates fine over a 12 discreet channel rig the only thing a 24+ channel rig is going to is just increase resoultion
@Shaun_Frank their system is "ok" its really not ideal for mixing in there... i cant stand the huge space... id rather have a tighter ctrl
@Chadwick_Morris tbh they're really the best option.
@Chadwick_Morris they're the gold sata's ya scrub. Totally don't suck.
@NRGgg @SHAQ we hit up you on a DM... got a discord link for ya
@SoutraOfficial which is why you manage your LFE channel through the LRC.rule of thumb :P

@Catbreadenter than beating "dubstep" to death.
@WhitBee I need to influence people over 18 to perform the difficult task of voting? That's kind of discerning.
@ivkowalenko @MikeMercenary he was mayor of Toronto, not PM. And if I recall correctly, despite all the hoopla, he actually did a good job.
@OMGITSDEDSEC prime minister. Same sort of deal.
@AcmeRoadrunner @MikeMercenary hahah I remember that
@rVogs wow. i dont meditate. you must be FAR more spiritually and intellectually advanced than me.
@TDCOLON I thought we were talking about artists?
@AndyRobot andy, im going to keep this thread super short. what the fuck do you want?
@m_larose0000 everyone keeps throwing this artist word around all of a sudden.
@AndyRobot with that said... there's probably someone out there who does it way better than you.
@davidwoellmer my rights. my choice. how is this eluding you... still.?
@davidwoellmer its using my marks without my consent. and i dont WANT to be associated with him. at all. simple as fuck dude.
@davidwoellmer here you are tweeting at me about it. im pretty sure you wouldnt have on your own volition.
@GangsterofGods go the fuck ahead... do you need help from an adult? is that why you're telling me? i can recommend some?
@GangsterofGods if "EDM vibe"is at the forefront of your life, id almost feel bad for you if i gave a fuck.
@davidwoellmer na, it uses my marks to help market his shit to idiots like you. I dont need that. i liked it when i never heard from you.
@GangsterofGods OH GOD PLEASE NO. LET ME STAY ILL SHINE YOUR FUCKIN HEAD. PLEASE GOD NO. ah fuckit, carry on.
It would be funnier if had rabies this whole time.
@manal21sinha @trent_reznor yeah, i like his work.
every time a blog posts, a 12 year old gets its wings.... then proceeds to tweet about it.
@Zack_Padilla relax child, everything will be ok.
@OpTic_DKarma lawl. i aint doin shit atm... aim_map?
@OpTic_DKarma sorry. was just sayin is all. &lt;3
liek omg, how com teh NBA only liek picks tall guys to play baseball? makes mi sick. they need to regulate dat
@Appills427 you could buy a midi controller with what you need for much cheaper
@tailopez whoops ... wrong twitter handle.same applies i guess
@gabycruz1997 i like nintendo. shut the fuck up.
k, gunna play some league for a bit.... then wonder up to the studio
@JesseBeaupre1 niiice shirts!those are kellys favorites
@kylegato zfs is zfs. no difference really.same gold WD drives. different chassis
ordered a Q30 from @45Drives today... lets see how it takes to fill up a 100TBNAS.
@OfficialRezz yeah that was all dean. They know me well
@_minazzz he's just waiting for you to turn the damn lights back on
@0fficial0yal yeah. It pretty much gives me a fair amount of context what's actually going on here. I remember being 18.
@0fficial0yal neither owned or operated by them.
@0fficial0yal what does that have to do with the ACC?
@0fficial0yal it got yours, and shit... I haven't even done it. Something's working.
@0fficial0yal I make songs for the acc? That's news.
@Palexio_EDM oh right. i forgot, you're an asshole when you create something and someone else exploits it. makes perfect sense now.
@ndrewsalvatore i think he pretty much nailed it tbh.
@Palexio_EDM I don't own the trademarks on mice named Joel. You're basically stupid. I get it.
@feedme nah, watch a few more... me and kelly are glued on it.try "nose dive" that ones fucked up.
@feedme yeah that one was kinda weak. theres some fuckin great ones in there.
@StarckClub mdma predates electronic music you idiot.
@pjrockz18 better at what exactly? let me guess, "spreading plur vibes" "making sick drops"right?
Doc Mcstuffins made 700 million this year by the way. whos that? some fuckin cartoon with a demographic that doesn't tweet.
if you don't know by now that pop EDM these days is a popularity contest and has very little to do with music, then i can't really help you.
@KayuzTunes well.. not like about "edm" or whatever. no not really. why should i?
@danfontavanilla @808Coug the sea and I don't really get along
@MrWoobie he probably does. Considering that I don't write kiddie pop and all that.
@grantsyourman no. Do I look like I'm playing the kiddie pop game to you? Is that the impression you're getting?
@LawrenceADoyle haven't actually called anyone out.
@AlexGreen319 because nobody infringes on you, idiot.
@Dj_Coog go back to from whence you came and take your drop with you.
@AlexGreen319 you should probably know that the opinions of 16 year old children don't hold much weight around this part of the internet.
@AlexGreen319 you showed me some graphs. show me some talent and maybe i'll blink.
@nestordiomediok fun fact, shit you post on the internet, stays on the internet. I hope this doesn't affect your employment.
@nestordiomediok: @deadmau5 nKill yourself shit
@nestordiomediok: fuck off @deadmau5! nyou're just a fucking bully makes shit! @marshmellomusic is better than you
@dylan_easter you don't have a fucking clue what im up to. and personally, i kinda like it that way. why bother guessing.
@dylan_easter more to life other than EDM paint by numbers. At least in my case anyway.
@dylan_easter invent time travel and stay in the past then? i don't know what to tell you.
@JScalzox_x that's nice. and i am gald you feel that way, however, it is not relevant to any of my endeavors.
@JScalzox_x but, i sleep at night knowing that i still know the actualuse of the word relevancy.
@JScalzox_x and it shall affect me oh so deeply as i cry into my pillow.
@blackmirror don't hesitate to ask for some soundtrack material! it'd be my pleasure :)
@TypicalGamer nose dive... or shut up and dance I'd say
@ManuDaGod then stay in kindergarten. Nobody minds.
Got me into some Black Mirror this week. Damn, it's like they made a show just for me. Love it.
Odd to think that I had nearly 350 cmos sensors catch trillions of photons that bounced off my pasty ass today.
@JustinCooney hah! Someone's onto us ;) yeah... that shit is bonkers
@simply_jonny are you brain damaged? 12? Or both? Delete your account.
@simply_jonny I can. Yesterday in fact. Got a platinum record. How's yours coming along?
Celebrating my birthday with Puerto Rico on Jan 5th ;) already excited to go back to PR
Off to @OTOY to get some insanely high poly scans done ;)
wish I had the reply on hand to satisfy the clickbait blogs update, but don't you know how hard it is to follow someone who's following you?
@jacobamuz relevant to what. The custodial arts? Finish the sentence, you fuckin moron.
@JlkLuc he can't afford the price I'd put on mentioning a name.
You'd figure someone "on that level" as it were, would be less reliant on someone else for the highlight reel. Guess not.
difference is, I've never felt i should parody a bucket in my video to cover up whatever insecurity I have with sub-par trap production.
Well go ahead and bring your mau5head. Sorted it out.
.@Wonderland_HI can I bring my mau5head? Or are you going to be a fucking douchebag about that too?
.@Wonderland_HI the fuck is wrong with you? Let the kids with mau5 heads in. It's Halloween for fucks sake. The fuck did you expect?
@MikeMichelin right on. I gotta bounce before dog the bounty hunter shows up. See ya sat!
@MikeMichelin your neighbour @ConorDaly22 is at the table
@MikeMichelinah ahaha right? Get the wings tho.
Well I made it to Hawaii. Hey, @DogBountyHunter, bet you 20 bucks you can't find me.
*goes to Hawaii, ends up in LA* lets try this again tomorrow.
@Intermach_Music first of all, this is nowhere near "news". Second of all, I copyrighted my music which was used in the aforementioned track
@TommyBuilt I wish. I do fucking love that head tho
according to left behind, all babies are inherently good, so they all get whisked away. Clearly, they've never met any of the babies I have
"Mom! Chloe got me the brand new baseball glove I always wanted!" - some shit acting from some shit movie.
@Wakie__ no. i am not. oh wait, unless you mean i'm not 12? is that what you mean?
@rodgermoore well id rather stay at fuckin 33 in that case. LOL
i'd like to take the time to thank all my fans and friends for typing my name in a box and hitting enter. means the world to me. thank you.
@KingJuliannnnnn that would be because i'm not a DJ you imbecile.
.@djmag when will you finally exclude me from this? So moronic.
@ProzzakOfficial we should do something non-shitty.
.@Traxxas @TraxxasRacing would you fellas be interested in us setting up a 3v3 RC Rocket league match?
.@skycrafthobbiesthanks for fixing my RC lawn destroying machine :)imma put a GoPro on it tomorrow. :D
@shancampbell99 please keep your little toy cars and your idiot friends far away from my home.
@hippiesdddrugs someone... other than you, of course.
@hippiesdddrugs be more specific.i dont go making twitter accounts to tweet you.
@hippiesdddrugs tell you what, if you do it, i will.
@RubenCisneros was it around the same time you listened on something other than a cell phone?
anyways.... i have to drive for like an hour to go eat food. back later.
@brandongregz @kaskade he's too much of a pacifist.
@steve_duda since youre here... does the sub OSC in serum restart? or is it free?
im just bummed out because my credit card expired and i have to go back to adobe cloud and put a new one in.
Just watched Swiss Army Man... best film I've seen in a while.
@iZotopeInc might have the wrong email, I'll dm you
im going to write a god awful track, and then im going to sell the fuck out of it.
going into the studio to bang my head off the desk and see what comes of it.
@RalphCabs im more of a real estate guy. it's pretty much a sure bet when it comes to investing.
oh... maybe it wasnt parts and labour. i dont know what the hell this track was.
i really want to take another crack at "Parts and Labour"... just found it again.
running through a billion project files to make something that resembles something that of an ablum. ugh.
yeah, kinda against the whole megaupload money cult. that kim dude seems like a twat of epic proportions.
whats the fastest way to propigate an 80mb file to everyone? got the 'eborts' thing mastered and ready, just need a place to stash it for ya
Why I don't leave the house:#27 an asshole gets out of his car to threaten me for taking a pic of his plate because he was being an asshole.
@jnwtts makes sense I guess. I just like previs at like 200fps. "Fuckit! We'll quantize it in post."
@jnwtts hah! Good man!!! Why's the playback system so slow tho?
.@kiloHearts server side installer compile for the win!you rule actually.
@kiloHearts dude, you gotta make an installer for the works bundle that just requires one serial. lol. ;)
That's a wrap. I'm going home to sleep for a week straight.
Haha! Spontaneously awesome ATL! Thanks for having us :D
Great. Emergency landing in Salt Lake City because some lady had a stomach cramp. Perfect.
@DJNickMiddleton oh then it's clearly all my fault.
You know what's NEAT, my set in Tokyo, and my set in Atlanta is actually on the same day at the same time.I HAVE INVENTED TIME TRAVEL.
@SteveAngello if I do a remix can I call it glory hole?
In all seriousness, relevant is by far my least favourite word.
@rockstarushabh weird, you'd think it would be there
.@DJNickMiddleton you'd probably be pretty annoyed if some plebs started ripping your shit off too. "Step off" he says.
.@Erikdisco much less the insane amount of manhours, technology, and development that went into it. It's heartbreaking really.
.@Erikdisco it's pretty frustrating to spend millions of dollars on an idea that sets you apart only to be poorly replicated by someone else
The thing that pisses me off the most is that he used chauvet LED panels. Get that shit outta here.
Hey everyone! I just invented a new stage! It's actually inside a deep hole filled with cement. Hope nobody rips me off.
something about an apple and a tree and how far it falls or some shit.
Just to clarify: wasnt @djtigerlily . The ripoff was some asshat named Erik Fink. Plot twist: he was actually krewellas old tour manager.
@luisp3rez do you really want to enter the realm of who looks like what, because a number of things come to mind on your end.
@luke_2013 on occaision. imma do some more of that when i get home.
@taramoore87 i did. time travel. get on my level.
This is by far the worst shit I've ever heard. Never showing up early again.
Oh god... I hope the new @Ford GT is going to be ready for the next @gumball3000 Dear car gods, hear my prayers!
Making the tour manager print, mail, fax documents is just my way of "sticking it to the man"
My tour manager is bitching me out over dinner for not using docusign. Now I'm going to make sure I don't use it so she has to print docs.
Such disrespect! How the fuck am I supposed to thrive as a musical genius if people are going to casually wear mau5 heads? 
Mommy! Someone put a bucket on their head and went to zouk!!! ... The pot and kettle emoji is long overdue. Get on it Twitter.
@datguyjohnnyson that's actually the amount of fucks I give.
@c0ndu1t oh good! Coz I got something for you too. Lol :) thank btw
No. He's not dead. He just has no idea how to be a horse.
@Vikkstar123 i do.. but im kinda in Bali with mediocre internet and no steam :(
we should probably set up an instagram account for the farm so people stop asking me for updates on chickens, goats, ducks and horse.
just found out that head cheese isn't actually cheese.
ey, @GuyFieri ... got a week off anytime soon? asking for a friend.
@DILLONFRANCIS i could probably make that happen
@DILLONFRANCIS i mean, why not Brendan Frasier... or Rosie O Donnel or something worth it.
@DILLONFRANCIS yeah but... why him? i mean, if you guys get along so well, wheres the fuckin fun in that?
@DILLONFRANCIS whos nghtmare anyway?im not cool anymore so i dont know what the fuck is going on.
@DILLONFRANCIS it should have been zedd... he was pretty useless on that thing.good times tho.
@DILLONFRANCIS oh yeah... i cut a whole bunch of new trails now... fall is literally the best time to go at night.
@DILLONFRANCIS yeah, okay, ill be there Halloween time ish.
@DILLONFRANCIS oh i doubt it... so many super talented DJ's here right now... too excited to even leave my room.
@DILLONFRANCIS oh, also, are you in bali too or nah?
@DILLONFRANCIS smh.... alright, ill run it by dina, and we'll put something on paper. gimme a few weeks.
@DILLONFRANCIS is this disclaimer actually legitimate? looks like you wrote it.
@DILLONFRANCIS - Dillon has the right to refuse purchase .... wut?
@DILLONFRANCIS alright... lemme give it some thought. ;)
@DILLONFRANCIS do i at least get a say in locale / activities?
@DILLONFRANCIS i mean, you kinda owe me 50k anyway.... #green
@DILLONFRANCIS i mean, i need more details other than 2 dudes being handcuffed for a week...
@PotcornMusic did you run enough effectrix on it?
@iamtwine relax turbo. I use a blocktogerher list to keep the spam down. Looks like someone added you to it. Who cares.
I'm less concerned about making big room than I am about the majority of people who take Beatport seriously since they tanked it 5 years ago
What's weird, we took down the sign and locked the door. Poor dude musta hopped the wall and stuck it back on just for that. Effort is real.
Well it's not really my fault... Touring 101. ALWAYS always always lock your room.Learned that the hard way myself, right @2chainz ?
anyway, back on track here, you can download the full 8400x6400 images from the flickr site if ya want. lil download arrow, bottom left.
i need to change it back to /deadmau5 now... had to change it to deadmowfive for a sec coz the other account was still there.
If I can get blacklisted by every fucking event photographer on earth. I'd be okay with that. One less kid taking up room at a show. People
@AbaunzaPhoto well gosh. Rip my dreams of being a hand model.
@AbaunzaPhoto is it just possible at all to have opinions and hobbies without some pro-twat chiming in?
@AbaunzaPhoto @RebeccaABritt i'd rather buy a fresh pair of socks.
@RebeccaABritt @AbaunzaPhoto I don't really give a fuck. Just stay in the pit and I won't bother you.
@AbaunzaPhoto shut the fuck up Leibowitz, nobody's bagging on photographers. Just the shitty edm ones.
@AbaunzaPhoto where did I claim it was my profession?
thanks @Flickr for helping get back on track... uploading a new album now! :D
Coachella photography: chicks with flower crowns EDC photos: fun fur, glowsticks and chicks with tits.Burning man: sand, fire and tits.
edm photography =hand hearts, the backs of dj's heads, and a buncha LED shit.
@wilw Adam tells me you have a hookup for mechanical robot spiders. I must acquire this knowledge.
@MKBHD just didn't want to have that shitty buyers remorse
@MKBHD hmm it was almost the same price as the 5d Sr.... They just didn't have it in stock right then and there... So I was like, withe
@MKBHD yeah :Doh hey... much difference (minus video) between the 5D SRvs. a 5d MKIV? youd be the guys id ask!
jesus... 32mb per jpg. lol... damn! what a sensor!
Of course. I venture outside to take a few shots and it starts to downpour. Still got some pretty cool ones tho :)
@twocaves first time I've ever seen anyone play it:) great job :)
@jingletard more or less.ill get em put somewhere somehow eventually
@johnnystudd69 you are the second biggest moron.check the release dates.
oh, @Flickr i havent touched my "deadmau5" account in a bit and now its switched to yahoo for logging in... seems im locked out now :( poop.
i should get back into photography i think.getting a little antsy being cooped up in a hotel.
@GadzGamz great work btw, been secretly following ;)
@GadzGamz right? its like the modular synth equivalent to making music... too much fun dicking around as opposed to consolidating ideas. lol
@BEHRINGER any deepminds land in Canada yet? Would love to get my mitts on one
@eranhersh said a guy with "releases" on high caliber labels such as ultra, and spinnin. Stop.
I think I'll try out a few new tracks this week at the shows... Nothing like a good field test
That was by far the easiest 22 hours of flying I have ever experienced. Thank you so much @SingaporeAir :)
@grizzlygage @whttrs ever hear of the patriot act? How's that working out for you by the way.
@grizzlygage I can deal with crazy. at least they aren't stupid.
@aka__V it worked by contacting the authors and getting consent. Just like normal people do.
@0TVKV none of which have even been remotely done.
@0TVKV @ddrreamboaatt "if you plan to make copies of your music and distribute the copies to the public." Well fucking geeee
@0TVKV @ddrreamboaatt yes it is. Shall I fucking show you?
@ddrreamboaatt when in actual FUCK did money come into ANY of this fucking equation?
@ddrreamboaatt who asked for money? Did I ask for money?
@0TVKV @ddrreamboaatt I swear you people are dumber than shit. No wonder a small percentage make it in this business.
@ddrreamboaatt common, uncommon... Does it appear that I give a fuck what everyone else does or thinks? My property. My rights.
@ddrreamboaatt it doesn't take an IQ over 40 to know I wasn't talking shit about anyone much less retaining my right to my music.
@ARMu5ic I'm not signed with Rocnation you fool.
@samsheffer ah! Guess it's one of those imma have to try it for myself things when it's avail. Lol :) cheers!
@samsheffer sounds good! Also... No more home button?
@samsheffer neat. So... I'll probably have one in 6 months. Lol
@mylescra mind if I come over and sample your mom?
@iBrandonAG @samsheffer *but not really in a hurry.
@iBrandonAG @samsheffer eh, probably at some point, by really in a hurry to.
@steve_duda sounds like a good time ;) I think I've managed to derank myself enough in doubles to have a 20 win streak. Hit you up l8r!
@andreahuston13 fine. Don't name one. Just blab about something completely off topic. That's works.
@Magik_Tijs I'll et my ass over there eventually
@josepano1 did you just call me a fag? asking for a friend.
@taiyohub we actually decided to copyright it when it was written and published... 8 fucking years ago.
there are way too many copyright experts on twitter.
.@Greycorpse yes. in fact, this is exactly how I stay relevant, by writing music for other people to use 8 years in advance.
@santiago_woeful hell yeah! Even if it means stealing music from other people. *smh*
@Ju_Hemenez Yes, that's exactly it. You're a genius.
@kushgino nobodies mad about anything. supporting music means not taking music from others with zero consent to do so. youre confused.
@SuicideChrist I'm only holding 50% of the publishing for that song, the other split is between Haley and Kaskade. So it gets sticky.
@DASTARDLYSHIT it's black and white. Amicable is neither.
@SuicideChrist im pretty easy to contact. You're contacting me now. No? I already intro'd you to dean too. Btw, I'm also indie.
@DASTARDLYSHIT it's just simply eluding you isn't it?
.@DASTARDLYSHIT The. Circumstances. Around. Using. Other. Peoples. Work. Without. Consent. Does. Not. Matter. Period.
@SuicideChrist @dean360manage would have been a good start.
@TynishaRae news flash. My life is more than a buncha fuckin tweets. But that's neat that you can assess an entire personality off Twitter.
@TynishaRae you telling me how I need to be isn't "criticism". It's just you being a fuckin idiot.
@TynishaRae you might want to consider, things like joy and passion still exist, and don't have to be shared with the whole fuckin world.
@TynishaRae 1. Assume to know who I am. 2. Assume to know how i need to change 3. Assure yourself you're right 4. Feel better about yourself
@TynishaRae because I am damn good at the business of music. Can't argue that. And yes. I am not a DJ. Possibly angry. I'll give you that.
@TynishaRae also, I should probably point out that the interval between your last two tweets was exactly 1 minute and 13 seconds.
@TynishaRae self hating? Have you seen your profile pic? Asking for a friend.
@fxckBryant doing everyone a fuckin favor. Thank me later.
@Handysizzle i tend to appreciate people who don't steal my work. But that's just me I think:
Beginner proptip: nobody is going to defend your work for you. If you don't protect your rights, people are going to shit on them.
@ASTRO_WAVES there's that deferring I was taking about earlier. We get it. You don't know shit, or actually have a part in any of this.
@ASTRO_WAVES well here's a bit of reality culture for you. It's my property.
.@primeofcydonia "we're fans" doesn't justify publicizing other people's intellectual property without consent.
@ANDYC_ram yeah... Was referring to that... Should have elaborated that it still sucks they were subject to council like that. LOL
@amieroberts11 yeah, stupid twat. I want attention by affirming my position on the suckiness of Fabric being subject to review. Extra stupid
@amieroberts11 are you extra stupid? Or just normal stupid?
Fun fact: doing a coffee run tonight. Hint: it'll be savage as fuck.
@NStorm20 nah. he just gets all pissy when you put him on his back.
can't hate those creative days when you actually manage to get shit done.
@wallinglaw you literally just made an account to suggest this?
trying to get out of this fucking lull... banging my head off the desk all day trying to write something. fek
@angelamkk in fact... why don't you explain to me what exactly a "hit record" is supposed to fuckin do for me.
@angelamkk hit records are super duper important dont you know.
@CaplesEvan protip: i haven't actually released anything since.
@rymdkraft UGH. i do. actually beren looking in boxes for the last hour.
i just cleaned up the studio. ill stream i guess. hold up. not sure what im about to do tho.
We put the @SharkWerks exhaust kit on Grills GT3.... Holy hell, I can hear her coming home when she's 4 miles out. BRAAaaaaAappPPP!!!!!
@Ulfh3dnar can we get Myfirstspacedoor.jpg in HD? I want this as a print to hang over my cats food dish. #polycount
@Ulfh3dnar now add some talent and originality and you got yourself a winner.
@HighEnd710 im almost certain you have no idea what im cooking up. music is a big part of my life, sure. but its not the big picture.
remixing our national anthem.... coz hey. why not. yay Canada
is it just me or did they get rid of twitch chat?
@joenorero because I put my money into my passion, not my bank account.
.@comtruise oh my god. i just heard you know what, for the first time... and thank you! so fucking awesome of you. :D love it.
@Cerebrexia @GoodbyeSpoons would you both just shut the fuck up?
@jeffnintel edm doesn't need attention. It needs talent.
@jeffnintel because I don't need to stand on the backs of others to see where I'm going.
just reinstalling some stuff and tracking down an SDI cable. hold up
i think ill do a cover of the Stranger Things theme... i rekon i have enough vintage gear to pull that off... should be fun. love the theme
@TheChuckler14 oh boohoo. Are you my enemy? I'm scared. Brb.
@TheChuckler14 will do. It's why pays the bills.
@djsnake waves die. That's the inherent property of a wave.
@EstherThePig there's enough room on the planet for everyone to do their own thing. Not against the cause, against the fucking evangelism.
@ToBeFrank_ didn't the English invent English? Pretty fucking embarrassing if you can't even speak it. Go to school.
Rest in peace Steven Krutschke, it's been a while... Sad to see you go. You'll be missed by many.
Thanks again Spain!! That was a fun breakfast :)
@DraftUK: Feedback on #WAF005, for everyone involved, has been amazing. Beyond thankful, and great to be among such talent. Now: #beats1
Off to spaaaaaiiin... Then boardmasters... Weooo
last day of R n R, then its back into the studio!
@lenniedofkes @ktheorymusic @StoneyRoads originally yes. But nobody really used it as one.
@ktheorymusic @StoneyRoads because it's a tb-303...
well... that's done. :) Time to install 8 LED tiles in my basement to start even more show development. Our work is never done.
@LuisParbhu as im sure your 300+ apparel companies'followbots care.
@datsik I'm feeling like staying in bed for another 16 hours.
Well! That was fun! Thanks :), got to go to bed. Srsly.
@datsik dude in really drunk. Forgive. Lol. Still playing
@emilysaevil I am over it. That's what "uh k" means. Stalk someone else.
@emilysaevil "uh k" isn't a bullshit tweet. It's an acknowledgment to the much overhyped banality of eating dinner as a normal ass person.
@emilysaevil maybe you'd be a dick if people started texting and tweeting every fucking thing you did with your personal time.
@realestcritic I surpassed banging pots and pans together around the age of 2.
@realestcritic please take your terrible taste in music and go fuck yourself with it.
@Dangergora none unless we bring in the sound crew and system. that's pretty normal. thought they did a good job last night!
@goandski hahaha that was just some prefab model shit they threw in there. no idea why.
man, you guys are in for a rare treat tonight for the @VELDFest afterparty at Sound Academy... hope you like techno.
were bout to deliver 6 LED panels to my basement so i can work on the show further ;) oh we're not done making this thing :D
thank you to @taittowers and the dozens of staff there for helping me build the new cube... really tunred out great!
@DukeRachel fun fact: veld wouldn't exist without me. :) #themoaryouknow
@specialKotler we started early coz dvvbs fucked off and I was bored.
The show was a success! I am alive. Nothing broke. And I am sober. Time to crack open some bubbly and fix the sober part. Thank you Toronto!
@VELDFest wut fuckin tree? i dont see a fuckin tree. wheres the f'n tree?
OH FUCK. i gotta go to veld in like 20 minutes.... LMFAO... i should probably get some shoes on or some shit.seeya guys n gals there!
@DefNotJake @thegeorgie_mac shush, it's his ace card. let him play it.
after this weekend tho, i am taking a MUCH needed break from show production work and changing gears into music mode.
@DJgioferri ever hear of it?try it. youll like it.
i swear im in a constant state of show prepared-ed-ness. ... working on updating my lib with some techno for sunday :D
@thegeorgie_mac theres a block button for that.watch this!
@thegeorgie_mac you being on dicks is not me being homophobic. thats just you being on dicks. now kindly step off mine.
@thegeorgie_mac out of the estimated 3.5 billion dicks out there you could be on, here you are.
@thegeorgie_mac i did, and put "talent" at the end. zero results.
@adamgduke @BT no you won't, they have hdmi and SDI outputs.
@BT always a fuckin option dude. Get LOS air fibre.
@BT get good internet. thats whats going to make or break your stream. not the equipment.
@BT dont bother checking it out, just get it. im telling you.
@mau5trap: time for @jeremyolander in the guest mix...#beats1mau5 @Beats1
breathin a little easier now. Just installed a 24,000lb cube on a stage and the stage is still in tact ;) it took 45 minutes to move it 5ft.
@BT look dude.Buy a trickster mini and 2 or 3 blackmagic cinema 4K pros. Done.
@autodesk @DanRoarty yeah, not sure whats up with the hat. lol
bout to get Grills 991 GT3 Sharkified later this month... lets see if she notices the difference ;) @SharkWerks
@IvyDaniels1 yeah yeah im gettin there... lemme eat these fries. be there in a bit
HOLY HELLLL!!! WHAT!?????&gt;SYESSSSSKJSDHFKJSDhKCANTYPE!!! SO AWESOME
Oh how they laughed and laughed when he said he'd start selling pizzas out of his hut. Who's laughing now?
Allllright. Touchdown in nyc! Snack, nap, then showtime )
Last day of rehearsals! Time to fine tune this bitch and get it on a truck... Or two, or three. :)
No joke, Eric and I and our team spent 3 months on that single show. We have some plans to expand on it, and perhaps bring it to the US ;)
Meatloaf??? FOR BREAKFAST? Lovin Tenerife already.
Well. Not gunna lie. That was religious. Thank you @ericprydz and @tomorrowland
Well... What if there's a parallel universe where parallel universes don't exist?
@tvgurl j/k... Maybe. Well see... I'm gunna be slammed until stage call doing show prep, but I can maybe sneak something non sweary in
If you guys thought the cube reveal at coachella was rad... This is some next level shit. I haven't been this pumped / broke in a while! :)
No. For real. They have our stage setup in a warehouse somewhere in the world and they just sent me photos. Ho Lee fuck.
@tvgurl nah.just put down "fuck yes" or "fuck no" after every other question. That'll suffice
My god @VELDFest is going to be fucking special... ;) pulling out all the fucking stops for this show... ALL OF THEM.
@AnthonyHdez58 what the fuck is an ass check? Typical moron.
@lucasrodenbush Tim Hortons no longer accepts face as payment.
@DEusebio97 trust me, you don't need a sign to point out how big of an idiot you are.
@DEusebio97 when you get fucking booked, dumbshit.
@DEusebio97 lemme know when that actually happens, in the meantime, DONT WORRY. I got you.
@DEusebio97 better yet. Let's just see you stand up in it while the panel motor unfolds the dome so I can laugh while you get decapitated.
@DEusebio97 let's see you stand up in a 5'1" mechanical dome and watch you perform a show.
Stay tuned this week as @nvidia and myself release more vids on the deadmau5 project :) GPU POWARRR!!!
@nah_dawg I get paid either way. Zero fucks given. Have a great day with whatever fuckin thing it is you do.
@nah_dawg I don't remember asking you a damn thing.
Welp, @ericprydz better be damn impressed with the control surface I programmed all week :p into rehearsals today!
@iRacing @NVIDIAGeForce chyeah! It's a @CXCSimulations rig, just upgraded the cards in it too, gotta get the vive goin with it!
Anyways... Couple more days of programming and rehearsing stuff and I rekon were good to go!
Hopefully I can find a hotel with at least 30% less blood and piss all over the mattress. @be_manos
@masterprogrammr making a cut has nothing to do with budget. You obviously have no idea how expensive top shelf CG costs.
@vivrantmusic I have no idea how to pronounce that. Oh well. Good music all the same
@ivona2403 and here I always thought the idea of booking artists was to hear their style. Silly me.
@ivona2403 I didn't know you were the entire population of Croatia
@bvsslord @awonderdj if I can figure out a way to make money off it, sure why not.
@Plurfectvibez nobodies disrespecting shit you pleb. Go pleb on.
@awonderdj @attlas yeah he's nice. Like almost to the point of annoyance, nice. I like to fuck with his head.
@bencollinge2 @awonderdj she probably already has some other shit deal.
@DruCanz @awonderdj I don't even know what she does
@awonderdj hire a nerd. Make a website. Host your own shit on there.
@DjSamCata @awonderdj who cares. I just hate SoundCloud.
@awonderdj you're fucking rich. Put it up on your website.
@awonderdj @SoundCloud fucking just figuring this out now?
@UnrealAlexander all good. :Pill be back soonish. we got some fun shit to make with you guys over there ;)
@UnrealAlexander BUT GUESS WHAT. back in the day they used to use transparent gels to make the colors... so maybe the order was wrong. :P
@UnrealAlexander hahaha and totally called me out on the white.
@punchesbears @SketchyBones defo has a trogdor vibe. I can tell by the consummate v's.
someone needs to hack into the pokemon go API and start putting hordes of extremely rare pokemon in the middle of busy freeways.
best thing about Atmos so far, ill never be forced to listen to a terrible mix because you cant put a brickwall on 32 discreet channels. :)
eh. went through about 6 years worth of old show content to re-map to the new cube setup. not fun.
I just usually avoid tweeting this time of year. It's kind of annoying.
IF YOUVOTE FOR ME IN THE SUPER IMPORTANT DJ MAG POLLS I WILL LIT A FAM AND COUNT TO THREE SO EVERYBODY CAN PUT PUT THEIR HANDS UP.
PLS VOTE FOR ME FOR DJ MAG TOP100. I WORKED HARD MY WHOLE LIFE TO HAVE A NUMBER BESIDE MY NAME THAT SHOWS YOU JUST HOW GOOD OF AN IPOD I AM.
@TrapStyleBass it is what it is man. I got an invite to make some cools shit. So I did. The rest is everyone else's schtick
@TrapStyleBass you do realize it comes with a piece of software
fuck, finally.3 weeks later, the veld show is nearly done being programmed. Tomorrowland show is done, now we just gotta rehearse it
i wonder how much of my life i've spent rendering.
@Sihk66 stage production / crew + crew logistics / produciton costs / rental costs / catfood / insurance ... lots of factors.
@jannarden these mand;m's aren't about to grow legs anytime soon.
@xdarkargent how many attacks and bombings have you endured as of late?
@MRobins_UK @WeAreRampage no shit eh? so much for originality.
actually i should make the eyes and mouth glow... that;d be neat. hold up!
@modularKeanu not really. in fact, its pretty optimized.
@FuntCaseUK thats my goto pose out of frustration.
@dudewlf there are several contributing factors, but it ranges to anywhere from $400,000 to $1,000,000 USD
.@BolierMusic exactly my point,you have a lot of tolerance, ex' you can sitll read the words with a lot of tilt.
.@BolierMusic ... and you comp that into your 2D footage.. and voila.
.@BolierMusic so basically, when you put in a mouse head model for ex. and match to camera... your render will be perspective accurate...
and optimal view distance is 20'... so... you need to actually project map it properly... even tho its a planar surface
so why do they render content like you are? the thing is at LEAST 7' from average 5'5 standing point
anyway... when youre looking at an LED wall at an event... youre not looking at an orthographic view head on from screen center point....
i just realized something that not a lot of "big LED screen in background" content developers dont take into effect for shows....
@lights im growing comfortable to fact that its not going to come.
after days of smashing my fist into a screen from accidental clicks, i am just now discovering the "protection" tag in c4d.STAY rendercam.
the old cube was way less than that, and it still looked great
the pixel count on the new cube is only 384x384x384.and thats considered pretty HD on a 13' cube.
@TypicalGamer it's not that bad really... Octane is crushing through it
@jdolbeer indeed... would be nice. but impossible to tour / logistically and nearly impossible to author 75m at least of content at that res
i could have probably cut my render time in half if i wasnt future proofing this shit for 4k. :(
caring less about the highlights of a music video and more about throwing copius amounts of GPU on my own *cough* original creations
@RickMalambri either way. yeah... but for the amount of sampling i need, this is really great. i cant model faster than i can previs. :D
@UnrealEngine :)i should share the stuff ive been tinkering around in UE with ya!
@RickMalambri yeah... i'd do it with 3x 1080's which should in theory smoke the X's... buuuut.... no cuda support for pascal yet. :(
@DjChubby_bunny lets see what happens when i stop paying attention.
cleaning up the war zone that happened in the backyard last night. lol
@prytard: You'll remember me - ATTLAS Remix is beyond GOD #beats1mau5
meowingtons obviously lost weight while being sucked into VR land.
fucking hell! rendering 20 frames in less than 1:30m.it takes my workstation 20 minutes to render a single frame, love cloud rendering!
alllright!!! sent an epic fur simulation for the cube to the render farm at @GridMarkets ... wish me luck!
@Hunter3901 youd need a whole room full of those to render this stuff out.
LOL... fought with volumetric lighting for an hour in Houdini... ended up cheating it to fuck with Trapcode's "Shine" ay lmow lmow
@GridMarkets just setting up my account stuffs :D
@Zedd unlucky :(yeah dude... doing it right takes fucking time.
in case anyone was wondering, the mid point of the new cube pixel map is x960 y610 for the center four pixels. now you know.
Grill has a snapchat, her thing is "kellyfedoni" but it's a lot of selfies and food and goofy snapchat filters.
Thank you Milan!!!! That was fuckin awesome. Scared that fuckin storm away :)
@SageLaw28 you'd know. Looks like you have two of them where your eyebrows used to be.
Um lightning hitting the ground nearby... This is not looking good.
Eyyy!!! Thanks @aircanada got my phone back. Lel. And thanks Madrid for the awesome breakfast show!
@donttrythis okay, that kinda makes sense! I'll have to up my... Err my friends drawings
@davekent28 having said that, you might want to start securing your own future and stop worrying so hard about mine.
@davekent28 great. Because right around that same time, I'll be doing whatever the fuck I want with a very comfy nest egg. Kinda like now.
And the guy who has the most draw is because he is the common denominator... It's not that complicated.
Promoters aren't booking based on skill or talent, they're booking on ticket sales. He who has the most draw. That's how it works.
@awonderdj I know. I was just stating that "relevancy" isn't important in the least.
Why be "relevant" when you can be enjoying breaking moulds instead of fitting into existing ones.
@awonderdj sometimes I dont look at people and wonder why it's just so fucking important to be "relevant" switch your goals up.
@prytard he couldnt do it if he tried. best were going to get from him is some hastily made photoshops and mspaint memes.
@chefito13 im not sure my back can even handle that kind of carry.
@chefito13 man, i dont want to collab, i worked hard NOT to sound like shit.
im so fucking glad they dont twittersource data thats actually used in real world situations
whoa... some serious animal shit is goin DOWN in the backyard...all sorts of screaming and barking and shit.
.@donttrythis how much PSI to launch a 4 pound object, 18 inches in diameter to a distance of 300 yards? asking for a friend.
or maybe just launch one large, singular confetti particle out of a 150 cal. mortar pointed at the "trap" stage.
funner fact: you dont have to disclose the size of the confetti particles.
fun fact: you'll have to disclose to a festival when forwarding production that includes "confetti cannons"
@Bryan_Baeumler i thinks its a weasel,we need to camp out one night with a .22 and a nightscope.
@Bryan_Baeumler oh... tango down at the farm.... one of the chickens got smoked... katie went out and only found a pair of chicken feet.
@bvaughan hopefully pure OSC... as opposed to sending OSC to Osculator then translated to MIDI for mbox. so sick of finagling shit.
@bvaughan yeah it's pretty straightforward, our maps are just 1080p
when you project onto a surface with a projector, youre seeing dimly reflected photons... LED emits them... thats the diff in a nutshell.
@MLGPuckett im in show production mode :( i have to haul ass... but sooOOon
but... projectors are a hundred times cheaper than hi res LED product. but thats the tradeoff.
and NOBODY wants to sit and rig projectors at every fuckin show... its unreliable as fuck.
projection mapping to surfaces with projectors is cool... you can get WAY higher res, but nothing near the brightness of surfacemount LED
@mxfox408 says the "fully grown adult".please stay in your sandbox.
@mxfox408 i apologize my "lack of relevance" to fourth graders. I will try to dumb my shit down in the future.
.@notch i publicly support you. (the period before your name further supports my claim.)
@gjonesbass what exactly does ones personal outlook have anything to do with ability? well, besides the obvious nothing.
@ericprydz errk. I neeeeed you to pick up the phone lol
@JKev94 have you seen what idiocy shows up on my timeline?
@JKev94 how in actual fuck is that trap? Jesus Christ, stay in bed.
@JKev94 what in actual fuck are you even talking about? Lmfao... My last two trap tracks? What?
@iFantasyyM I wonder where they obtained the rights.
@TheBuygoreSquad everyone works hard every fucking day. Special.
@MusclesM1 much less be able to spell and all that basic kind of stuff.
@DarthBeavis1 hah. clean setup! Rob's a great dude. good taste in machines!
i WOULD like to pack that really fine fine craft glitter into a confetti cannon at at least one EDM festival just to ruin a few lives.
@SammmmJo too stupid to realize it wasn't even a burn.
@SammmmJo thats some stupid shit. coming from a guy who hears stupid shit all day.
@SammmmJo you tell me. Seeing as you're following me and all... Kinda makes you wonder.
@Aeroteq those that matter dont mind. those that mind dont matter. - suess
Don't worry. I'll give this a whole week before we all find something new to whine and bitch about, in the meantime, I have a show to build

@SPORTBETTINGMAN @cgpgrey Very much so. This is an extraordinarily important problem, and solving it looks extraordinarily difficult.
@SPORTBETTINGMAN @cgpgrey It certainly seems difficult! Whether it's impossible is an open technical question, and an active research area.
.@SPORTBETTINGMAN @cgpgrey "AI: enemy or slave?" is a false choice. If aligned with our goals, advanced autonomous AI can act as an ally.
@SPORTBETTINGMAN @cgpgrey Rather than trying to keep AI "in check," better to design AI systems to learn correct behavior / goals.
@rivatez @FF_forgood Wow! Thank you so much, Riva!
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey More similar to doing climate change research before the advent of cars. Very difficult, but potentially valuable.
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey Given the sizable risk from accidents, we should probably focus on accelerating reliability/robustness research.
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey "Good guys" can cause disasters by accident, and trying to outrace all rivals can mean cutting corners on safety.
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey There's a huge amount of uncertainty, but also a lot of research we can do today to try to reduce uncertainty.
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey Certainly not! But while roughly human-level AI depends on us, the same may not be true for much smarter systems.
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey Agreed, but 'Is AI advance foo imminent?' is a different question from 'Is AI advance foo risky?'
@Nelson_Bridwell @cgpgrey Agreed. Unemployment certainly isn't the reason to be concerned about the global impact of general-purpose AI.

Many thanks to everyone who made our end-of-the-year fundraiser a success! Our total was $351,411, with 176 unique donors contributing.
@NateHerrell Functionalism looks much likelier, but our primary concern is with smarter-than-human systems' functional states regardless.
.@ciphergoth We're 82% of the way to target 2, with 24 days remaining in our fundraiser. We'll see whether our momentum keeps picking up!
Curious about what MIRI researchers work on, and why? Tweet questions to us; we'll be writing blog-length answers every Monday and Friday.
@michael_hendrix: Private sector has invested more in #AI in the past 5 years than all government funding ever.n- Stuart Russell @ITIFdc
@WhyChadIsRight @robertskmiles FLI's twitter is @FLIxrisk. Another relevant group is @CSERCambridge.
Investing advice from @sama: "AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime there'll be great companies."
@CasparBowden Unclear, but raises worry we might harm the AI. Bostrom discusses WBE and neuromorphic AI, which are likelier to be conscious.
Thanks to the generosity of 100+ donors, today we successfully completed our matching challenge, raising $400,000+ for our research program.
@FHIOxford: @elonmusk Glad you agree. Currently there are 10x more researchers studying dung beetles than superintelligence!
@elonmusk: Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.

@EricHerboso Thanks, Eric! Though, note that it's $250k of in-kind donations, not $250k in cash.
@robbensinger Thanks! But to clarify, it's not $250k in cash, it's $250k of in-kind donations from Microsoft, mostly software apparently.
@AnimalCharityEv Thanks! Though to clarify, it's $250k of in-kind donations from Microsoft, so not worth $250k cash.

@abethcrane: Just made my first #SVGives donation to @MIRIBerkeley! (Whoops was meant to start last night #mybad).
MIRI fans, we have fewer donations than usual this hour, so we might not win the $2,000 prize. Please give in the next 7 minutes!
@montalvoarts The four of us in the office laughed so hard at this. :)
@montalvoarts Yup! We even told all our small donors to prioritize those early morning hours, since they seemed easiest to win.
@montalvoarts No bots! Just virtual hangouts with a large contingent of our donors all day long, and lots of energy drinks. :)
Learning about other cool SV nonprofits via #SVGives: maybe current #3 Design Tech High will train up the young talent MIRI needs to hire!

@EbyEmenike In the meantime, does the same thing occur when you plug an external mouse?
@tawlaq no updates yet. We'll keep you informed if there is :)
@chrstphrolsonHi Chris, sorry to hear about that. Have you gotten an exchange from @TigerDirect?
@TobbeBecks If you plug it into your computer does it read? If not it might be a hardware issue. Just trying to narrow down the actual issue
@TobbeBecks when you plug the charger in, does the battery icon show?
@TobbeBecks Hi Tobias, you mentioned that you have protection over it - did this issue occur when you dropped it? Need more details to help.
@TheDaveCA Hi Dave do you want to drop @ASUSCanada a call instead at 1-888-678-3688 or DM us the actual issue?
@supahjay808 Hi Jason we dont have an official release just yet but I have seen people upgrading it manually
@mtlboy30 Did you mean using a USB drive? You'll probably need a slimport forto connect to the tablet
@lxcsxn If its a charger issue, just send in the charger
@WolfsGoRawr Hi ace, could you DM us your issue so i can help? :)
@lxcsxn Let me know if you need any further assistance :)

@beanswab Hi Brad, could you DM us the issue you've been facing with along with your contact details so we can follow-up on this?
@MD_Philinex I'd go with the ASUS UX32VD-DH71 (16GB) or a K55VM or a G74SX. What do you think, @ASUS_ROG ?

@rmora210 hi which model do you have? that's really odd. have you tried getting a replacement?
@RainbowPixelz you'll have to check with @ASUSAU:)
@w_illo_w I understand. I dont think we have them in Italy just yet but please check with @@ASUSItalia for when its being released there
@losingrace its either that or an internal battery issue. I'm just ruling out the possibilities here.
@JHigglesBF ooh sweet! Take a photo/video when you can!
@Nigel_Dench First thing to do is to try holding the power button up to 60 seconds.If that doesn't do it, try a cold boot power on
@losingrace Hi Laura which model is it? maybe i can help
@stuffner11 sure, please drop us a message with more details
@bettyace Hi Betty, I've just sent you a direct message with the location and contact numbers of our CS teams in Kenya

@derMR Hi they just got back to me. Could you drop us a message with your email add and what it's regarding so I can relate it back to Deu?

@unders_core Sorry to hear about your experience, that should not have happened.
@DJJamieDee could try contacting the CS team for either a replacement or refund
@DJJamieDee depends on when you got the issue with the product prior to purchase. you might be able to :)
@scott_daigle haha no news on global's side. you might wanna check with the regional teams if they have anything going on locally :)
@AG_Shizz Hi Nathan, it depends on what you're using it for, budget and other priorities (battery life or performance)
@SixOkay thanks for the heads-up Justin! Will inform the web team.
@hanamabc still need your RMA number to help you check it out :) Pls follow us to DM with your RMA, location, product s/no and; contact details
@chengxuan_ you could try booting with the RAM set to 1066 Mhz and; also test with just one DIMM to see if the boot times change
@Saeros2 The 4930K is better. It has a slight 3%-5% performance increment over 3930K but and both will do fine on the X79 deluxe board
@Thomas030 it's made from LEDs that light up in the shape of a Christmas tree :)
@Saeros2 will feedback to the CS team in Canada :)
@hanamabc that should not have been the case. I tried using other RMA numbers and they came out in English. Mind DM-ing us your RMA number?
@Saeros2 no issues there :) It's hard to do upgrading options with our current business model so we leave it up to our distributors :)
@Saeros2 I have mentioned that to them as well. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. Sorry for the inconvenience
@Saeros2 upgrading is based on retailer's policies not ours :) I've dropped them a line to check for your RMA. We'll be in touch
@hanamabc which site were you on, where are you located and what's your RMA number?
@sahilmalhotra2 its better to get it from ASUS India for warranty purposes. But if you want, amazon and newegg would be my frst go-to sites.
@joeymk no news yet :) will let you know if anything comes up
@Saeros2 OK. I will ensure that it goes through :)
@mikronyx99 haha wow, that's a big ask. We're good for now I think :) Thanks for the suggestion though! Who knows, eh. Maybe in a few years?
@Saeros2 Hi, not sure what you're asking. But the serial number (based on the box) would be BAM0AC104728.
@Saeros2 ok so long as you've re-registered then :) let me know how it goes and if you need any assistance
@xBlood_Monkey next time then :) @xMadmike01 where are you based at? I'm sure there are a few regional Christmas giveaways going around now
@Saeros2 who is it register under? could you DM us your RMA, contact details, location and product s/no so I can help? :)
@BtheSportsGuy @savagebeast0123 no issue, we'll be in touch :)
@ApolloSC2 I'd go with the ROG G75VX, U36JC or Zenbook UX21 depending on your priorities - budget, battery life and; weight
@robertoggsp Hi, when you connect the keyboard does it indicate "dock connected" on your screen? If not it might be a manufacturing issue
@mattatoBTO the ASUS VG248QE for sure! It has 1 millisecond response time and; a Full HD display with 144hz refresh rate - dedicated for gaming
@DJJamieDee @VikiBednarski hi could I grab your product model, s/no and more details on the issue that you're facing? any RMA number?
@BtheSportsGuy @savagebeast0123 sure, you can drop us an email at socialmedia@asus.com
@BtheSportsGuy @savagebeast0123 Could I grab the product model off you so I can help you further?
@the_kolbatron Hi Kolby, sorry about the delay. Just got into work. It depends, might take awhile with Christmas and; all. Right, @ASUSUK?
@savagebeast0123 @BtheSportsGuy Hi, sorry to hear about the issue you've been facing with your product? I can help you look into this case
@csal_iqbal It can run 16GB but that's the maximum it can go so I'd rather go with the G-series that goes up to 32GB to be honest :)
@DebyOneHEAyes Reus! Although if you are serious about gaming I'd suggest one of our ROG Gaming laptops :)
@itsjonsense sponsorships are done on a regional/local level. I'd recommend checking up with @ASUSUSA:)
@dresmall @fuseproject @heistprojects haha glad you liked it! :)
@ThomasRCassidy which product model and Windows are you on? :)
@AndrewToburen Would still need you to DM me your contact info :) If you have a case no. and/or your product's serial number that would help
@bitchquiffs Is this a brand new laptop or did this happen after an update. (What's the product model by the way?)
@AndrewToburen The UX301E uses a 802.11 b/g/n Wifi and the UX301A is running on a 802.11 a/b/g/n Wifi
@karlboll the unlock drivers can be found on our product sites under Drivers and; Tools &gt; Android &gt; Utilities.
@teresags @compumundo Hi Teresa, drop us a DM with your RMA number, product model and s/no., email and mobile contact so we can assist you
@karlboll Just got news that since Padfone (A68) and; Padfone 2 (A66) both have their unlock tools released, there will be no further updates
@AndrewToburen Hi Andrew, so sorry, I just got this. Will look into it. Pls DM @ASUSUSA your RMA no, product s/no, email and; mobile details?
@bitchquiffs Try hitting ctrl+shift+esc (task manager will open) the process that crash is: Asus Smart Gesture Center. (finish it)
@grimvover9000 no details yet but watch this space and @ASUS_ROG's
@Torontobound Sorry, I just assumed! My bad. I'm afraid I do not have that information :(
@saadkhan07 sorry to hear about your experience. could you DM us your contact details and; issue so I can raise this up with upper management?
@ivanmhcenteno you're looking at roughly USD $1,457 for the Trio - it's a tablet, laptop and PC all in one :)
@MD_Philinex where are you based at and what products were you looking at?
@gabriel_lag Hi Gabriel, which model of the TF are you referring to? :)
@jermanv hey Jermany, saw your comments on the youtube comments. have you tried getting a replacement since it occurred 2hrs after unboxing?
@andrewhpalmer you can speak to @ASUSUK for more details on that :)
@BtheSportsGuy Hi, what seems to be the issue? can I help?
@crippsy_99 drop me a DM with your RMA number, product model, serial code and location . I'll see what I can do :)
@AndrewToburen hi Andrew, care to elaborate a little more? might be able to help you out from here :)
@Dhampire13 hi Deborah, sorry to hear that. Could you provide us with more details via DM? We take your feedback very seriously.
@flumpyvilla3 ASUS MeMo Pad HD 7 is about  comes to mind. what do you think @ASUSUK?
@ivanmhcenteno I tried it, should be able to. if you repeated the steps again, it would indicate that you've already registered for it
@Ewaisha sure Vicky. you'll have to follow us on twitter to DM I think
@natataCAMZ hmm if this was recently bought you could try to get a replacement from the retailer. Bring your receipt.
@FeltSF Hi E, can I help? What seems to be the issue? :)
@MD_Philinex Hi James, we don't have an international store, we sell them via retailers. :)
@drakh you're suspecting that the battery is bloated? Have you tried contacting the CS team on possibly getting a new one?
@natataCAMZ Hi Camz, just to confirm, you tried plugging it in but the battery isn't charging?
@_camillafaye me-ow! Thanks for sharing the love!
@RKBarcaFan cheers. glad to hear that it works well now
@Frank_Orman Hi Frank sorry for the delay, could you drop us a DM with your RMA number(s), product model, location, email, mobile contact?
@drakh oh wow. that should not be happening. did you just purchase it recently? you should be able to get it replaced if you did.
@FelixFran15 you could try but keep the original and place it back if you encounter an issue. wouldn't want your warranty to be voided :)
@RKBarcaFan hi Rami, care to elaborate? maybe I can help you out from there :)
@prashantmahajan Could you DM me with your details (RMA number, email, mobile contact, product model and serial number) so I can follow up?
@prashantmahajan hi Prashant, sorry to hear about your issues with the CS team there.
@MattGiacomazzo I'll have @ASUSUSA to take a look, thanks for the heads-up :)
@seanspratt hmm will have that checked. in the meantime, can I help? drop us a DM if it gets too long :)
@MelMelistheone sorry Mel, I'm not too sure about that. I think a generic one should do the trick though :)
@natataCAMZ Hi Camz, which of our products are you using?
@Jessevd Could you drop us a DM with your name, RMA number, product serial number, location and contact so I can follow up on this?
@_andrewphillips you'll have to check with @ASUSUSA on that
@NutaLucian sorry, its still in the works. We'll let you know when it is out :)
@WeAreFocusrite @MMMClass great way to kick start the weekend you guys :)
@ContinoBSM I'd be happy to take a look at the website which you're referring to :)
@ContinoBSM there's a price difference between the two. It depends on the usage of the user and what the amount they would like to fork up
@crippsy_99 sorry about that. ask for a replacement, I'll back you up
@MelMelistheone haha what can I say? It feels good :pbut then again, who doesn't right? Cheers Mel.
@MelMelistheone :) got your glow in the dark casing yet?
@lalitadvani so just to clarify, the @Flickr website doesn't work on the X55C? which browser do you use for it?
@MMMClass @WeAreFocusrite cool! would totally love to hear those tracks :) could we feature you in our #asusspotlight as well? :)
@VeeforVictoria hi Victoria could you follow us on twitter so I can drop you a direct message to guide you through this? Thanks
@FelixFran15 Hi Felix, not sure as to what you're asking. are you asking if you can insert your own external video card or which type to use
@jcteitloff @google glad we could help you make it for Thanksgiving!
@MelMelistheone i just clicked on a random product and it worked. @GetpriceAU
@ContinoBSM If it's incorrect, send it back to the store, or if you're not sure to get it changed :) Hope that clarifies things.
@ContinoBSM when you purchase it the packaging will indicate Sandisk or Adata. On soft, you can go to device manager check under Storage.
@MelMelistheone I dont think you need to register. Just click on what you would like to purchase, add to cart and then checkout @GetpriceAU
@ContinoBSM you have the option of having it with a Sandisk's U100 or ADATA's SandForce SF-2281
@MelMelistheone think you should ask @GetpriceAU :)
@ansk13 if I'm not mistaken, that's region specific, ie the warranty will only be valid within USA if you're purchasing the r9290 from there
@ansk13 that depends on the model and where you bought it :) which graphics card are you looking at?
If you're in #Singapore, you should totally check out our #ASUS booth at #SITEX 2013 at the Singapore #Expo Hall 6 from now till 1 Dec!
@erichaupt awesome! which ones are you looking at? :D
@lalitadvani Could I grab the model number? Were there any system updates before this problem started acting up?
@VeeforVictoria hi Victoria, what system are you running on? Win 8 or 7? How long have you had this problem prior to purchase?
@lalitadvani hi Lalit, could you provide us with more details? Will be happy to help with the issue you're facing at hand :)
@cleaner haha delayed gratifications are always the best, my boy :p
@cleaner well watch this space :) we'll updaet you soon if and when that happens
@Fikriardeans I'd go with the 62-bit. make sure its with 4GB of RAMS though :)
@ShakirAmeer Sorry to hear about that. You could try contacting the CS team and requesting for a complete replacement instead.
@matkartweet It'll quicken the process if you need warranty service in the future :) also would help if you're travelling a lot.
@ItsPlez was it working before installing Windows 8? What's your product model?
@ItsPlez Feel free to check in with us, I'd be more than happy to help you out :)
@mikeocd not too sure what you mean by @ASUSUK 's oress office but their support hotline is +44-8448008340, open Mon to Fri from 9am -5pm
@t103Ninja you'll have to check with @ASUSUK on that
@rayhaan03 please include your email,, location and mobile contact details so that we can contact you directly as well.
@rayhaan03 we apologise for your experience :( pls know that we take your feedback seriously. Could you kindly DM us more details?
@RichaardFinland haha nice try, you could try out for the transformer pad giveaway though! :)
@Tom239487 haha or you could do what I did and skipped till the end :)
@Tom239487 if you search for Xonar DX and add it to the compare list, both those 2 products should show up
@Tom239487 DSX has a beter sound quality and has the option for a daughter board that adds 5.1 option all with full size RCA connectors
@BH_FR_Ahmad fair enough, sorry for the inconvenience
@BH_FR_Ahmad good thing the key itself is still functional though. Should have sent it in when you had the chance if it was that annoying :)
@AmandaJoy If you'r still unsure it might be worth having it checked out. If you think it's a battery issue :)
@AmandaJoy By doing so a blue screen appears with more useful information. You can now search for a resolution using the text from the error
@AmandaJoy (2/2) untick the Automatically Restart box and then hit OK.
@BH_FR_Ahmad you can go to any tech repair shop and get a laptop key retainer or get them to do it for you. It shouldn't be too costly
@BH_FR_Ahmad since it was bought in 2012 it might be out of warranty, you could have fixed, the solution should be quite easy though
@MilkBefoCereal Exciting stuff! would be interesting if you're making a gaming laptop!
@RichKessler3 hi Rick, how did you go with the last DM i sent?
@brendawambui it probably will not be fully covered by warranty, it might be partial though, depends on the condition. speak to them :)
@AmandaJoy hmm try going to Start&gt;Computer (right click) &gt; Properties&gt;Startup and Recovery&gt;Advanced&gt;Settings and; uncheck Automatically Restart
@BH_FR_Ahmad we dont have a trade-in program per se but some of our retailers do. I know Amazon, for example, does.
@ztalpnielk @BH_FR_Ahmad just to clarify, the physical keyboard key keeps coming out? have you checked it with the closest CS team yet?
@blakespot I dont think they're in stores anymore
@MilkBefoCereal haha that depends on which PC or console game you would like to play first doesn't it :p #firstworldgamerproblems
@RichKessler3 you have to follow us on twitter first I think
@RichKessler3 I'll try to walk you through the process from there :)
@brendawambui Hi Sachin, oh dear, please contact Francis Wambua at FrancisW@mustek.co.ke - the service centre is Mustek, located in Westland
@RichKessler3 hey Rick, which product is this? maybe I can help you out ;)
@crippsy_99 hi Stephen, could you drop me a DM with your RMA number, product model, serial code and location so I can chase them for you? :)
@evanburness the Zenbook UX301 is 1.38kg which is 3.042 lbs which is as much as a MacBook Air 13 just to give you a comparison :)
@Kvytautask haha we will in due time :) watch this space
@MelMelistheone nice! link? do take a photo of it in the dark, would be cool to see the nexus in action, glowing in the dark :)
@wisenotherwise that's ok because I'll check Facebook anyway and help you from there.
@wisenotherwise so clearly I know which TL guy in the ASUS CS team pissed a customer called ConfusedSay? You see where I'm coming from right
@wisenotherwise and your name on Facebook is ConfusedSay am I right?
@wisenotherwise I am serious about looking into this but I would need your details to take it up with HQ and fix the CS team in Bombay.
@wisenotherwise look, I hear you and understand your frustration and clearly this is the first time I've heard about this case.
@wisenotherwise I'm sorry to hear about your bad experience with the CS team in Bombay. I will raise it up with upper management on this
@brassman75 Sorry for that, was going to drop you a DM and then realised that you weren't following us, so twitter doesn't allow me to
@brassman75In the "Playback" tab, select "Digital Output Device" or "HDMI" as the default device, click "Set Default" and click "OK"
@brassman75 Right-click the volume control icon on the bottom taskbar and; click on "Playback Devices" to open sound options
@The_1_and_oney sorry to hear about that. could I check what model are you on?
@rcsamayoa glad I could help. Sorry for the delay
@rajithadotco haha I totally know what you mean.
@rcsamayoa I think it should be fine from there. Just clea/defrag your hard drive every once in awhile and it should be good to go.
@bhawnachirps nope, but sending the christmas e-card does :)
@overkillrigz_ph you'll have to check with your regional ASUS team with regards to the release dates @ASUSph might be able to help :)
@DrunkMSNBC haha don't worry, it does exist :) it's not a unicorn, bro.
@DrunkMSNBC this will vary from country to country, your best bet will be to check with your closest ASUS office :)
@MaziarKia cool! would love to see a picture of it on the ASUS screen :)
@BrianVanB hi brian, sorry to hear about your bad experience. can i help? :)
Wish you could #transform into a #multitask-ing superhero? We want to knowdon't forget to use the above hashtags #transform and; #multitask!
@MelMelistheone not manufactured by ASUS, we do have other colours though
@MelMelistheone I meant sorry for the miscommunication, thus confusion that was created. No you don't bug me but I'm also replying others
@MelMelistheone there are a lot of 3rd partues that provide accessories for Nexus. I was pointing you to generic sites where you might find
@andreashj52 so sorry, hope I wasn't disturbing, it's 9.30am from where I'm based at
@andreashj52 Can I get the model name to assist you?
@temafrank through the serial code. that will happen on the backend if the series are a defective lot.
@Krym0r Hi Adame, sorry sponsorships are done on a regional level so you'll have to check with your nearest ASUS office :)
@FlashDesignsYT yes we will not permit mediamarkt to install the graphics card as it will break the warranty
@FlashDesignsYT I would advice you to keep the original VGA card if and when you do require it to be serviced
@FlashDesignsYT What is the name of the PC you are using? Do you have the name of the graphics card he installed for you as well?
@FlashDesignsYT correct me if i'm wrong, so you're asking if you install a new graphics card whether the PC warranty will be void?
@dcarnelutti yeah I've feedback to the web team but if you un-tick and tick it again it would say that you've already submitted :)
@dcarnelutti it will register once you get the questions correct :)
@dcarnelutti once you click on send should land you in a page asking for your contact. I'm using chrome too. let me know if its not the same
@shin_taro_taro please understand that we're not the social media team not tech support but we can try to help as much as we can.
@shin_taro_taro what model are you having and was this issue something that occur when you bought it or after?
@GeorgeHague I do not have that information as sales and packages are organised on a regional level. please check with your regional office.
@FlashDesignsYT hi how can I help? what seems to be the issue? :)
@MelMelistheone Hi Mel, which tweet? I'm sorry I think I must've missed it!
@J_Melendezc the prices vary from country to country so youll have to check with your regional office
@YmirWarBearMFJ sorry the prices vary from country to country so youll have to check with your regional office
@lynx1964 hmm, have you tried to do a factory reset?
@lynx1964 Settings &gt; Developer Options, and check 'Force GPU rendering' and let me know how that goes
@MelMelistheone haha what's stopping you? :) go for it!
@MelMelistheone Just doing my job. take a photo of it when you've got it and tweet it over alright? :)
@JoelCHoffmann I apologise. Read that wrongly. It varies from country to country but I'll definitely feedback to them.
@JoelCHoffmann and then at the backend we gather data from the complaints we have, feedback to the product team
@MelMelistheone I mean any online store that ships worldwide
@jfranfernandez sure I'll drop them an email. Could you DM me your direct email and contact number as well so we can be in touch directly?
@MelMelistheone you can actually buy them in any sort of global retailer, shouldn't be an issue.
@jfranfernandez have you tried asking the CS team about this, considering that this is the 2nd charger that broke a few days after warranty?
@MelMelistheone that's odd, we didnt receive a DM on Twitter from you. You have to follow us on twitter to drop us a message I believe.
@achirinos sorry, I have no information on that yet
@mtlboy30 sorry I cant disclose that information :)
@wagoner_luke what's the model of your laptop and were there any updates done before this situation occur?
@vborovikov it varies from region to region. please check with your regional ASUS office :)
@wagoner_luke hi Luke what seems to be the issue? maybe you could elaborate so I can help?
@WharfRatJustin have you tried contacting your CS team regarding the dead pixel? Have you got an RMA for your 11m old laptop?
@schafzahl_n it varies from country to country, please check with your local/regional ASUS team :)
@Lly_pop hi which phone model are you using and what android version is it on now?
@baileysplease Hi, could you elaborate more on this so I can help? you mentioned charging, is this a battery issue?
@niaelizabeth93 what seems to be the issue? :) can I help?
@ProminenceTeam could you drop us a DM? :) thanks
@freggioli I'd advice contacting your closest CS team and; requesting for your "mastercode" specific to your laptop and; serial no to unlock BIOS.
@ProminenceTeam hi could I ask what this is in regards to so I can pass on the relevant contact?
@ZoeChij hi Zoe, could you give me more details? when did this happen and when did you buy your laptop?
@jfranfernandez hi, could you give me more information on this issue so I can help?
@pyrced @Android sorry for the trouble. Could you DM us with the RMA number, product info, contact and; location so I can take this issue up?
@mtlboy30 still no confirmed plans for either 4.3 or 4.4, sorry!
@SMoonCassinelli I've forwarded your case to higher management and the US CS team. We'll be in touch.
@SMoonCassinelli Hi Sarah, thanks for your details. Could you drop us your contact details as well so we can be in touch directly as well?
@mister_bonilla must've been a manufacturing issue. It really should not have been the case, I apologise.
@mister_bonilla hi Chris, that should not have happened. have you tried returning it and getting a replacement?
@efox29 hi enrico, could you expand on this so I can try to help? :)
@AMRAAM_Missiles For P8Z77-V yes. The pro version onlyhas 1 x wireless atenna
@AMRAAM_Missiles nope it does not. only boards that are certified with Wifi-Go do.
@sadidipto you mean the headquarters? It's in Taiwan.
@SMoonCassinelli sorry for the trouble. Could you DM us with the RMA number, product info, contact and; location so I can take this issue up?
@AMRAAM_Missiles the wireless antenna on the rear panel replaces the WiFi card, you'll just have to install the WiFi drivers to make it work
@AMRAAM_Missiles the V-LX does not have the WiFi-GO feature unlike just the -V version.
@mason_wheeler5 what seems to be the problem? could you drop us a direct message with your RMA/product number and; location so I can help :)
What's Pi multiplied by Le.et? (you're welcome) #nerdjoke #funfriday have a great Friday everyone!
@wisenotherwise could you drop us a direct message here with your RMA/product number and location so I can help follow-up on this?
@OhimeSamaXIII We don't have a NS90 motherboard. Are you referring to the NX90 notebook?
@Dagger22789 that's adorable! thank you for sharing that with us! made my morning :)
@intel: The first-known use of the phrase "O.M.G." was in a 1917 letter from Lord Fisher to Winston Churchill. #TechHistory
@lea_ratzmann sorry to hear about that :/ I'd recommend using Google docs for the time being :)
@DariusMuzzy nice try. but stay tuned for our campaigns and you might get a new one if you sign up! :)
@DarylJones97 Hi Daryl, where are you based at and how long have you been waiting? Could you drop us a DM with the delivery order number?
Hi @AnastasiaHass could you drop us a direct message here with the issue you were facing, your RMA number and your location so we can help?
@Bash0o0ra when there's an upgrade, in terms of firmware, doing a factory data reset is usually the best option.
@CoffeeGeek could you follow us so I can send a direct message :) thanks
@ThatDECAguy If there's any bets running on this I'd be happy to take the comission :) (Joyce@ASUS)
@ThatDECAguy haha it actually comes from the word "Pegasus". It's actually pronounced "ey-soos" so you're friend is technically closer.
@frosland sure Lars, could you drop us a PM message with your personal details as well? It'll be easier to follow-up that way
@CoffeeGeek sorry to hear that! mind dropping me a message with the issue you've been facing, location, product serial number so I can help?
@photoFrance70 nothing is confirmed with regards to the android updates as of now
@gopi_pillai @unnikartha I've received your mail but can't DM you back unless you follow up. I will follow-up on this case nonetheless.
@gopi_pillai @unnikartha could you drop me a direct message with the issue you've been facing, location, product RMA number so I can help?
@brianbotkiller could you drop me a direct message with the issue you've been facing, location, product serial number so I can help?
@Ferranza you'll have to check with your regional ASUS team @ASUSItalia
hi @stephcunnigham could you drop me a direct message with the issue you've been facing, location, product serial number so I can help?
@tea_n_toasted ok. could you drop me a private message with your details and email contact so I can check it up with @asus_za? Cheers.
Technology plays a big role. Our protagonist, James, makes use of it in 2 different situations. How has technology changed yours? #transform
@MSmikoto I would suggest waiting for its release in Korea rather than buying elsewhere in case you require technical support in the future.
@MSmikoto it varies from regions. It's better to check with your local ASUS team :)
@ElectricBump can I check what the issue is with the support website?
@peterbowyer it's a PLS Panel :) #PB278 #productivity
@AStateOfTrancee we can't comment on any future devices, sorry!
@AStateOfTrancee We weren't hacked, just an oversight of an over enthusiastic employee visiting the Facebook office for the first time :)
@EveningStarNM Our #Zenbook UX301A will be out shortly, check with @ASUSUSA for more info on release dates!
@Tendoboy1984 Thanks for your interest! Hit up the folks @ASUSUSA, as they'll have more up to date info for the US market
@jemmyloveshugs @Android @googlechrome enjoy your #Nexus 7!
@unu_ch for the US region, please check with @ASUSUSA as they'll have more info regarding which retailers will carry it.
@haldo13_38 Sorry to hear of your troubles. May I ask what region you are located in to better assist you?
@AdWhois sorry to read of your troubles! Have you contacted ASUS customer support?
@Vict0rMeldrew Hi, sorry for the delayed response. We don't sell replacement parts directly to the end user, please contact customer service
@Travispenner the serial # is also in the Nexus 7 settings menu. For warranty issues, please contact your regional customer service center.
@jamesvc1 try uninstalling/reinstalling the wifi drivers. If that doesn't work, please contact the ASUS Customer Service center.
@marinusklasen I stand corrected then :) please contact your regional ASUS Customer Service center for assistance!
@marinusklasen it can be repaired for a fee, since the new Nexus 7 is not yet officially sold in the Netherlands
@chrisgander Check with our @ASUSAU office, as they'll have more info on pricing and availability in your region.
@evancolegrove They're both real, just depends on the region's keyboard you're purchasing from :)
@asususa: #didyouknow from Intel's #IDF - the latest phone processors have more performance than a Pentium 4
@dustinberkley poke the guys over at @asususa, as I believe that office handled the promotion. Congrats!
@billythebigbone @asus_usa sorry to hear of your troubles. Please DM your RMA number to us
@obelixtwit did our customer service asses what was wrong, or just state it was OOW and you would need to pay for repairs?
@sweilem1 All in good fun ;) We love us some @KitKat, just like we have previous Android desserts #nomnom
@mszpirt took some asking around, but yes, the Xeon E3-12xxv3 will be supported in a future BIOS update, expected around October.
@caseybradford Yikes! Hope you weren't hurt! Please contact the @ASUSUSA service center ASAP.
@hsg_82 It's only available in select markets, you can try purchasing one online from Taiwan, Singapore or Hong Kong.
@mrkrands sorry to hear of your troubles with the Nexus 7. What was the issue each time?
@asususa: #DidYouKnow: An #Intel 22nm transistor can switch on and off well over 100 billion times in one second.
@asususa: #DidYouKnow DirectCU II means that Copper (CU) heatpipes come in Direct contact with the GPU; the "II" symbolizes the 2 fans
@thales873 we'd like to think so :) best bang for the buck tablet that hits a performance sweet spot.
@MijoRimo we don't have a trade in program, sorry! You can always sell it and buy the new version though!
@edwardikim have any questions about a particular #ASUS model?
@sp_curran have you contacted ASUS customer service? They should be able to let you know how much the repair will cost
@antti_r strange. It loads up fine for me, as well as on two other devices. Have you tried from another device?
@sjh5244 you'll need to check with @google, as they determine when/where their Nexus products will be released.
@krisseemarie sorry to hear of your troubles! did you contact CS to get your issue resolved?
@mjcobley Sorry to hear of your situation. Just to confirm, none of the keys on the keyboard are working?
@nathanr1989 you can also try pressing FN+F2, which turns on/off wireless functions.
@nathanr1989 sounds like wireless drivers may have been uninstalled. Find the drivers for your respective laptop on the asus website
@nathanr1989 what seems to be the issue, and have you contacted our Customer Service Center yet?
@wackybecky actually, that pic is of the Fonepad Note 6!
@darrypars call us biased, but we think it's great value for the money, especially when compared to non Android devices :)
@llyrdavies88 make sure to use the official charger that came with it, and not a 3rd party one. Let it charge for a while and turn it on
@5sexsofhemo1996 if that doesn't work, then I'd recommend taking it back to the retailer and exchanging it. Hope this helps!
@5sexsofhemo1996 Try holding down the power button until it shuts off, then try turning it back on.
@flockapalnos good question! it depends on what model CPU you want to upgrade to, and which board of ours you choose.
@sarahkaye__ shedding? that shouldn't happen...which model and what screws?

@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
@SpaceX: Falcon 9 first stage has landed at LZ-1
@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much Rand;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.
@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.
Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
@emenietti @chafkin Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed
Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much.

@jovanik21 @Veidit No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.

@Veidit No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.
@jovanik21 Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.

@qriosity_ @MacTechGenius No rare earth metals in battery
@MacTechGenius App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
@FredericLambert Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority
@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text
@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
@Wise1919 @FredericLambert Rolling out a new update today.
@iamDeveloper Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless.

@rtoro20 Really? I already have both feet in my mouth and am levitating on my own idiocy...
@marcelsalathe Not perfect and; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to "1st" place means it's essentially on par
Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?
@AanstadGard Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
@BullFlags Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
@W4AS Good grief, I'm not "working" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.
@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)
@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.
@OldManRiver1800 Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism.
@alext4627 That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
@eveegdmann Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
@DanielleBloeme Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive.
In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council and; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong.
At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost
@PeterGleick @business First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
@mcun1 Yes. Green cards and; dual citizens already ok. Work and; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action.
There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
@ReesAndersen @FLIxrisk Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity
@TeslaMotors: Meet the utility grid of the future. Tesla's Powerpack installation at @SCE's substation will reduce the LA Basin's relian
@JacobofAmber Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material
@Hyperloop: Congrats to WARR Hyperloop team for fastest pod--flew down entire length of track at the world's first Hyperloop competition
Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong and; don't deserve to be rejected.
The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country challenges
Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
@_wsimson Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX
Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
@MichaelEMann I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
@Michael_McLean That may be a difficult award to decline
Tillerson also said that  risk of climate change does exist and he believed  should be taken"
@TheEconomist ... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."
@redletterdave Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ...
@danahull I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
@danahull Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.

@stephenstohn Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present
Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.
@dnansink40 Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
@HendrikStruik The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted
@dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically
@VinnyLingham Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.
@gdoehne Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.
Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
@UKPJD Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory
@TOCHOTE Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
@cameronrad Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot
@ModularLifeSys @NHTSAgov It might. Am not sure.
@gavinnwaters Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
Report highlight:  data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.
@OlivierW4 There will be many improvements to HW1 over the course of the year
HW2 Autopilot now downloading to all HW2 cars, but in non-actuating mode to assess reliability. If looks good, actuation by end of week.
@JimDeKort @SpaceX Rotates 180 degrees and does a retro burn
Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship.
@brandonr182 @sama Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
@MotorTrend Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
@JRMYGRNBRGR Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.
@trevoclark Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1.
Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
@redletterdave The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
@mbhnyc It will in an upcoming release later this year
If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000
New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 and; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
@vicentes @DragTimes Late Jan, along with Linux kernel upgrade
Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw.
@IridiumComm: Milestone Alert: The first ten #IridiumNEXT satellites are stacked and encapsulated in the Falcon 9 fairing. #NEXTevolutio
@andrewket Almost there. Undergoing final validation. Might go out in next few days.
Deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends
@quipme Occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future
@djsearle @FredericLambert Yes, grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions
@FredericLambert A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?
@yamenalhaddad Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
@ddaogaru If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back
@SweensChris Should complete in 2017. One is def planned for Swift Current, near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my 18th bday.
@darkdude203 It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel, it will be quieter.
@CMaggiore50 Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car 42.
Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too, but takes much longer.
@pcwizardllc No major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads
@vicentes That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
@SamLawrence 8.1, which hopefully goes out next week.
@DragTimes Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week
Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well. Just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of environments.
Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...
@loic You're right, this is becoming an issue. Supercharger spots are meant for charging, not parking. Will take action.
@edwardsanchez about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases
@Mederinho10 @BW @business at least some of them
@stryker_88 That doesn't make sense. Will look into it.

Vote tally shows ~85% of unaffiliated shareholders in favor of the Tesla/SolarCity merger! Thanks for believing.
@ArminKeyani All P100D vehicles produced to date, as well as new. This is purely a software optimization.
Model X numbers should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile
Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month
@AustenAllred Wow, thanks. We won't let you down.
@ID_AA_Carmack we could enable that, although the cameras use grey, grey, grey, red detection, so it would look a little greyish red :)
@InLucidReverie a bit like that, but hopefully a more meaningful role for humans
@muodebe Both UV and IR (for heat) reflective. I burn easily and; then my nose looks like Rudolph the reindeer, so I totally understand.
@MrSpanier No, but maybe a light tartan. Plaid is reserved for the next gen Roadster.
@davidtayar5 Tesla will def absorb SolarCity debt. Altho extremely unlikely, I would pay it personally if need be. Debts must be honored.
@SeltzerPlease @PlayOverwatch My kids and I are having a great time!

@DragTimes might have an early access release ready by then

@bakkedahl use buttons on left side of steering wheel
@MacTechGenius I'm the only author, so, love or hate it, that's me. I've learned some lessons though, such as tweeting on Ambien isn't wise.
@MacTechGenius I personally like the 6 seat best, but the new 5 allows the entire back to fold flat. A small family could camp there!
@John_Gardi We will probably offer that as an option
@MrRoryReid @MykalSoCal @BBC_TopGear @TeslaMotors Loving this thread :)
@balaji_kann Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.
@BitterMercy Excellent safety in rollover (5 star+). That was what took so long to develop.
In addition, we reinforced the surrounding body structure for improved safety (was already 5 star in all categories).

When you want your car to return, tap Summon on your phone. It will eventually find you even if you are on the other side of the country
When searching for parking, the car reads the signs to see if it is allowed to park there, which is why it skipped the disabled spot
@TeslaMotors 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonars and radar all flush mounted and body color. Beauty remains.
@vicentes latest autonomous hardware allows for easy computer upgrade
Should mention that retrofitting to full self-driving hardware is very difficult. Cost delta is more than buying a new car. Wish it weren't.
@elonmusk Still working on the video. Fully autonomous drive demo only completed several hours ago.
Will post video of a Tesla navigating a complex urban environment shortly. That was what took the extra couple of days.
@elonmusk This is also what I was alluding to by Model 3 part 2
Tesla announcement goes live at 5pm California time. 30 minutes of media Qand;A to follow.
@FortuneMagazine This is because the first 12 months of production are sold out
Moving the Tesla announcement to Wednesday. Needs a few more days of refinement.
@Cocoanetics @heiseonline Not actually based on science. Objective data shows Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.
@saufkopf87 @FortuneMagazine Utter nonsense. Empirical evidence is what matters, not random speculation.
@jovanik21 @arstechnica @drgitlin Sounds like a great move!
@hohocho That's why we need to accelerate solar power
Real fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for "subsidies", Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero?
@ithrow88 @Walpoleboy6_RBX impact velocity and center of mass of colliding object make a big difference
@Walpoleboy6_RBX: @elonmusk Tesla Model S saved my life. Hit a 1000lb bull moose. 2 tiny dents.
Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.
Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th
@FuncRandm I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.

@YostRobert @StephenAtHome Yeah, and several others at various times. My twitter list is trimmed down to almost all news/comedy these days.
@mrDeanMiller When we upgrade the core Linux OS to 4.4, which is probably December
@TeslaMotors: Tesla's first Powerpacks in Africa will be paired with solar for an off-grid installation at @Singita_ safari lodge in @SA
@motherboard I use twitter for news orgs. My Insta has same women as men. What's up with the phoney PC police axe-grinding?
@Space_Station: Cameras outside the space station captured dramatic views of major Hurricane Matthew as the orbital complex flew 250 mil
@kakurady @xenophrenia Exactly. Those are the best ones.
@MacTechGenius Going out this week for X and outside North America
No irony or uhh "shade" meant here. T's character is excellent and well-played. Worth seeing.
Some of the future episodes of Westworld feature my ex. Talulah does a great job of playing a deadly sexbot :)
@futuregames: modelled the Interplanetary Transport System in @KerbalSpaceP and; can confirm that @elonmusk's centre gimbal stack works...
@bearsper Will do a Reddit AMA on Mars in the next week or two
@GoodDayM Am tracking this down ... Super important to be fair. There are zero discounts even for family and friends.
@GoodDayM Something messed up here. Tesla policy is equal pricing for all. No discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was damaged.
@BArtusio Three cable elevator on a crane. Wind force on Mars is low, so don't need to worry about being blown around.
Waiting for everyone to reach their seats and get settled. Starting in 5 to 10.
12m rocket booster diameter, 17m spaceship diameter, 122 m stack height
@rocketrepreneur Meant to say 200 AR for production vac engine. Dev will be up to 150. Beyond that, too much flow separation in Earth atmos.
@rocketrepreneur 382s is with a 150 area ratio vacuum (or Mars ambient pressure) nozzle. Will go over specs for both versions on Tues.
Chamber pressure is almost 3X Merlin, so engine is about the same size for a given area ratio
Production Raptor goal is specific impulse of 382 seconds and thrust of 3 MN (~310 metric tons) at 300 bar
Aiming for Oct 28 unveil in SF Bay Area of new Tesla/SolarCity solar roof with integrated Powerwall 2.0 battery and Tesla charger.
@ccyuan2013 @TeslaMotors @tsrandall yes. Also, only worked if you logged on to a malicious hotspot and; used browser. No customers were hacked.
@thefrownyface @massossltd I read a story about a father whose son died incredibly quickly. Can be as little as half an hour in hot sun.
@RoyArne83 currently stops at 20% state of charge. This number will be configurable.
@ninjas "smart" preconditioning should be less dumb in 8.0
@Scott_Helme can't always detect babies and pets
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin and; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.
@PassionPlanet1 Yeah, definitely one of my favorite names
@andyzalk sounds like the right name for the rocket booster
@LarryMasters778 That is my favorite fictional spaceship. Powered by improbability!
Maybe Ultimate Spaceship, Version 2? Mostly because it is not the ultimate and there isn't a version 1.
Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name
@vicentes @EdibleApple Hoping to start WW rollout of 8.0 on Wednesday if no last minute issues discovered.
@danielringdahl @P100D Glad you like it! I think we will probably stop at 100 kWh on battery size.
Tesla Model S loses 28% after 50k miles, a Mercedes S-Class will lose 38%, a BMW 7-series will lose 40%, and an Audi A8 will lose 41%.
Will do some press Qand;A on Autopilot post at 11am PDT tmrw and then publish at noon. Sorry about delay. Unusually difficult couple of weeks.
@SpaceX: If you have audio, photos or videos of our anomaly last week, please send to report@spacex.com. Material may be useful for inve
@abadcliche Most likely true, but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors
Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.
@ashwin7002 @NASA @faa @AFPAA We have not ruled that out.
Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
Support and; advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA and; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com.
Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
@scrappydog yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine.
Finishing Autopilot blog postponed toend of weekend
Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
@Lockyep Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change.
We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks
Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.
Major improvements to Autopilot coming with V8.0 and 8.1 software (std OTA update) primarily through advanced processing of radar signals
@BelovedRevol Making progress. Maybe something to announce in a few months. Have played all prior Deus Ex. Not this one yet.
@MattHardigree: The Tesla Model S P100D is now faster in a straight line than it would be if you dropped it out of a plane.
Journalist Qand;A for 30 mins and embargo ends at 12:30
Tesla product announcement at noon California time today
Sunday morning: to bake or not to bake cookies -- that is not even a question. Definitely bake.
Congrats to @TalulahRiley on her novel, "Acts of Love"! All characters  even those based on real people  are entirely fictional 
Would like to thank @nvidia and Jensen for donating the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer to @OpenAI in support of democratizing AI technology
@verge Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters, but plot and; editing could've been better. Really needed more Joker+Harley.
Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
@ChristopherMori Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
@JamesRossi100 probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
@RoadandTrack @TeslaMotors Model Y (compact SUV) off Model 3 chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
@tomschouteden @DMC_Ryan @voguemaster @Jalopnik good point
@DMC_Ryan @voguemaster @Jalopnik I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y
@sethpascale @TeslaMotors glad people had a great time!
@voguemaster @Jalopnik not bad, I like those suggestions
Some good guessing by @Jalopnik. The Tesla Minibus will be built on a Model X chassis. People density potential is surprisingly high.
Should mention that Gigafactory will be fully powered by clean energy when complete and; include battery recycling
@ID_AA_Carmack Maybe as a future optimization. Would only matter if it was extremely big.
Looking forward to the Gigafactory opening party on Friday next week. The scale blows me away every time I see it.
@danahull Jerome is driving Tesla Semi and; doing a great job with his team. At Daimler, he led their most successful semi truck program ever.
@danahull It's inspired by some of the California Custom VW combi design art
@MRamseyWSJ Great game. Whole Fallout series is amazing.
@katiefehren Both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning
Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot and; Model 3 today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan
Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket
Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
@BilalNaseer Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that "they know better". Makes no sense.
@MacTechGenius V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day.
Tesla customers are v smart and; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%.
@heroineworshipe @BoschGlobal It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection
@MacTechGenius Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
Have to focus on tonight's @SpaceX launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla.
Promising call today with @BoschGlobal, maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update.
@reddersla Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
@ForIn2020 @KellyBlueJazz On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it's real
@ForIn2020 @KellyBlueJazz large amounts of crack
@KellyBlueJazz 6 hours normally, but a lot less these days
Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
@pfierens Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust
@erik_smith1 @ihavetweets certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
@ihavetweets effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
@DanistopMe only just gained access to physical vehicle
@att1cus86 @DMC_Ryan AP process crash would show up in logs
Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar
@DMC_Ryan Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster.
Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on.
@kumailn @RealDaveBarton @JuddApatow @SiliconHBO @FredericLambert @MikeJudge can't wait to see the costume
@RealDaveBarton @kumailn @JuddApatow @SiliconHBO @FredericLambert Only if I can play a monkey
@SwiftOnSecurity Tricky in 140 chars, but: 1B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that.
@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it "beta" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine that wasn't criticism, just clarification
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
@vicentes Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
@chirag Use of word "beta" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense.
Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week.
@BrooklynBrett @LeoOD3 @Conleich Story was fed to LAT and; many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a 5!
@alansmurray No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony and; didn't get my tweet.
@gdoehne @disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert.
@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert.
@jacobrossi All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include.
@apple_defense @samabuelsamid Exactly! I love Twitter.
@alansmurray If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about 1M+/year deaths from other auto companies?
@alansmurray Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market.
@nickbilton: 1.3 million people die a year in car accidents. Yet, 1 person dies in a Tesla on autopilot and people decry driverless cars
@artem_zin @theaweary Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
@NikolaNikolov16 Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare; nIt is enough I may but call her mine.
@newsycombinator @mashable We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
@Recode Article is misleading to readers. No one is "taking home" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table.
@WilliamShatner Of course. Our love will never die.
@KatelynBrock Drive units and battery are sealed
If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential :)
We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation.
As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
Ascent phase and; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship
@seanmcarroll Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will.
@seanmcarroll Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely.
@seanmcarroll No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
@spoite @rsmoz Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
@rsmoz That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics
And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one
@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.
Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
@DefTechPat That is correct. It was about innovation.
Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model 3 cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
@tedismeiamted @PlayOverwatch @Blizzard_Ent PC, of course
@ahess247 @Recode I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
@JedBrown5 @renzdimaandal @Goetzman @Tom_Stears exactly
@renzdimaandal @Tom_Stears It is simulations all the way down
@lessteza control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
@mattyteare @karaswisher @waltmossberg @YouTube autosteering chutes will be added soon
@iwanttobeanurse Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this and; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max and; used up contingency crush core, hence back and; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.
@SpaceX There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.
@SchaFFFFFF Flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions.
@jlgolson No prob. We care about doing what's fair and; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there and; we make amends when wrong
@jlgolson Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no.
@jlgolson Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.
We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less and; less of the Merc story appears to be true
@drkevinleung @Tesla_Canada Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri.
@joshuapinter @juliusvolz Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.
@margotroosevelt Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
@bittdk Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely.
Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good.
@r_SpaceX @reddit will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
@jdickerson: Seating at breakfast has made me a Tesla enthusiast reporter. Base on table of owners next to me, the joy from the car is i
@vicentes @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens @CNET coming soon
@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
@lukealization Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.
May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way
Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
Filtering particulates from air makes a significant and; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
@MacTechGenius @SacEV Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best.
@JohanMancus Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
@SacEV next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly
Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.
@phillipcjackson turns out it doesn't need securing
@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.
@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.
@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better
@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
@dannysparker Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster
@RealDarthBL We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where.
Activate autopilot 4X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon.
@thelonelyisland Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not :)
@levie Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think.
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX and; SolarCity over the years. Thank you.
@POTUS Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
@NASA @sgvcrime @SpaceX @Space_Station Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
@arstechnica Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none.
@nonesuchzach Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic.
Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation.
@samboykin @danahull the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
@Recode Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse and; don't want to read from a prompter.
@LaurenShearer1 Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
@MThorpXXi We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S to a Model X
@Christiano92 @Inspron @Jerry22499879 won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height
Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells.
@lordsshrivas Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
@AmarnathRevanna Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster
@torvos torque is shifted between front and; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before
@grebakshay We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
@vicentes Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
@raytech247 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.
@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
@Jbourquee Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind and; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night.
@JackLipstone should be within a week or two max
@Alyssa_Milano Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.
Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.
Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!
@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network
@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later
Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing and; Ireland.
Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person
Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up.
@rossbin You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve.
Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production.
@mikegaalsf Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window.
The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
@marcthiessen: I interviewed .@elonmusk at @AEI World Forum and @realDonaldTrump never came up.Discussed his plans for manned Mars mis
SpaceX and; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service.
@wk057 @TeslaMotors Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.
Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks @SES_Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions.
@Astro_Valdric @TeslaMotors We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
.@curtismcauliff SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo.
@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though.
@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7.
@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend.
@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
@LeilaniMunter: "This is a fun car Elon!" new footage from 1st time I drove @TeslaMotors Model S, with CEO @elonmusk riding shot gun htt
There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%.
Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude
Worth watching "Nathan for You" on Comedy Central, particularly the "Dumb Starbucks" and "Mechanic/Realtor" episodes
Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
@chriskreidler @engadget yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer
More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017
@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude and; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating and; rotating.
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.
Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land and; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY
Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon.
First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!
Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday.
Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence 
Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
@mashabletech @mashable Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the 16th and launch about three days later
@MikeBloomberg: .@elonmusk delivers a simple message, a rev-neutral CO2 tax will lead us to a sustainable future. That's an idea mayors 
@MikeBloomberg Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
@ID_AA_Carmack Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!
@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
@levie Sounds perfect, you had me at "enterprise".
Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot@teslamotors.com.
@kevinmitnick Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit
@anakinSGE Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time.
@GangsOfGtown Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term.
@abrax4s Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months.
@javashri Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
@roneijlander We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here.
Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars and; batteries in CA and; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide
@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!
Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)
@elonmusk Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
@sAlmaneei already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
@M4XRodri planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
@jonthomason yay! Always happy to make others happy
Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says 97% of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test).
Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
Autopilot release to Europe and Asia pending regulatory approval. Hopefully get the ok in the next few weeks.
@Meddd__ @aaronpaul_8 Watched the whole series. One of the best tv shows ever.
@roymoody Depends on regulatory approval, but hopefully end of next week
@lordsshrivas Lots of upgrades and a new look, although main UI upgrade coming with 7.1
@TeslaPittsburgh Non-autopilot will have a new interface too. More comprehensive UI update coming with 7.1.
Some exciting news this week: Tesla Version 7 software with Autopilot goes to wide release on Thursday!
CH4 rapidly decays back to CO2 and; is absorbed by plants. What matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground oil, gas and; coal.
@HamiltonOfiyai Intentions are good, but massively overweights CH4's effect on climate.
@appleinsider I didn't walk back anything, apart from media hype
Regarding the watch, Jony and; his team created a beautiful design, but the functionality isn't compelling yet. By version 3, it will be.
Yo, I don't hate Apple. It's a great company with a lot of talented people. I love their products and I'm glad they're doing an EV.
@Avron_p you can mount a rack to the roof via suction cups and still have one Falcon door work fine. Guaranteed up to 140 mph.
@stumplahoma @mashable door is larger than opening and acts as an umbrella. Upper interior trim has hydrophobic coating.
@sasatokic @mashable Front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are chamfered back
Model X Bioweapon Defense Mode definitely filters viruses btw, even the small ones. Has hospital operating room level filtering.
@johnzabroski thanks, that's a great idea. I think we can do that.
Btw, price of Model X is actually only $5k more than S. Lower cost versions coming later.
In expendable mode, Falcon Heavy can send a fully loaded Dragon to Mars or a light Dragon to Jupiter's moons. Europa mission wd be cool.
Dragon 2 is designed to land on any surface (liquid or solid) in the solar system. Am glad to see people thinking about applications!
Btw, not saying we *should* nuke Mars -- just layin' out a few options 
First production cars will be handed over on Sept 29 at our Fremont factory
@ScottLucasNV Lithium deal is not exclusive and; has many contingencies. The press on this matter is unwarranted.
@elonmusk $35k price, unveil in March, preorders start then.
Model 3, our smaller and lower cost sedan will start production in about 2 years. Fully operational Gigafactory needed.
With same options, Model X is $5k more than an S due to greater size and; body complexity. Sig Series is fully loaded, hence high price.
@Forbes I appreciate the kind words in the article, but, judging by the picture mods, it looks your Photoshop bill was very high.
@BjornNyland Provided all ten take delivery, you have indeed!
The car will learn over time, but there is a min caliber of starting quality.
@tallakt Various forms of shades are being considered. May not be necessary though.
Final corner case is dealing with low contrast lane markings (faded white on grey concrete) while driving into the sun at dusk
Almost ready to release highway autosteer and parallel autopark software update
@ID_AA_Carmack Even if inevitable, we should at least attempt to postpone the advent of AI weaponry. Sooner isn't better.
Model S product call at 11 today. Rocket discussion at noon on Monday.
Expect to reach preliminary conclusions regarding last flight by end of week. Will brief key customers and; FAA, then post on our website.
Cause still unknown after several thousand engineering-hours of review. Now parsing data with a hex editor to recover final milliseconds.
That's all we can say with confidence right now. Will have more to say following a thorough fault tree analysis.
There was an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Data suggests counterintuitive cause.
Falcon 9 experienced a problem shortly before first stage shutdown. Will provide more info as soon as we review the data.
Important to note that Model S resale value is also higher than that of gasoline cars
To be clear, SpaceX is supporting a student design competition for STEM, not trying to build Hyperloop itself. Other cos are doing latter.
SpaceX/Tesla will also do a reference pod to be shown after the @Hyperloop competition. Bonus for all racing teams that exceed reference.
My kids love "The Lost Planet" by @RachelSearles. Now on a rare second read!
@kpe @SpaceX @grierallen @natedapore Cool, thanks for letting us know. This is helpful for figuring out fairing reusability.
What are the best riddles you've heard that are short enough for Twitter?
Another good riddle: drill a hole thru a sphere such that the height of what remains of the sphere is 10cm. What is its remaining volume?
@TeslaP85D That is true. If someone says they are thinking about having kids, I always encourage them to do so.
It is total BS and; hurtful to claim that I told a guy to miss his child's birth just to attend a company meeting. I would never do that.
@voxdotcom I have never written or said this. Ashlee's book was not independently fact-checked. Should be taken w a grain of salt.
Max acceleration was 6X gravity, altitude 1187m, lateral distance 1202m and velocity 155 m/s. Main chutes deployed 970m.
Dragon abort test stats: 0 to 100 mph in 1.2 sec, top speed of 345 mph
@romn8tr Press conference went way over time. Tried to give all the journalists who'd traveled far an opportunity to ask a question.
Rocket launch good, satellite in geo transfer orbit. Still so damn intense. Looking fwd to it feeling normal one day.
Worth watching @ExMachinaMovie. The AI would be in the network, not the robot, but otherwise good.
@bonnienorman New Roadster battery should complete safety validation by end of July, so likely available in August
Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.
@Aero4Real I only invest in companies I help found or to help a friend or a cause (no return expected for latter two)
Droneship is fine. No hull breach and repairs are minor. Impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.
If this works, I'm treating myself to a volcano lair. It's time.
Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.
Launch window always tight when orbital synch needed. In this case, Space Station. For Earth-Sun gravity null point, moon was in the way.
Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud
Odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50%. The 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead.
Have asked SolarCity if we can do something philanthropic with the CA aqueducts to help the water crisis. Investigating
We debated this, but there really is $10k gas saved by most owners over 5 yrs (avg ownership period). Since it's true, we are sticking w it.
Waited to say something until after we fixed some of the options pricing (too high) and colors (too many similar)
@StephenKing: Took my Tesla out to a dragstrip last week and ran the 1/4 mile. 112 MPH, 0 to 60 in 4 seconds. Like driving an X-Wing fig
Battery "breakthroughs" need to state power *and* energy density (not the same thing), plus how long they last. They usually fail on energy.
Welcome @Chiefboltkennyh to @TeslaMotors. He will apply Formula 1 techniques to revolutionize servicing mainstream cars.
@johngreen @hankgreen You had me at Sheen or Gaddafi. Must admit to liking "The Fault in Our Stars" too. Sad, romantic and beautifully named
With all that solar power being generated, it almost feels like something is needed to complete the picture ...
SolarCity just hit a new daily energy record of 5GWh two weeks after reaching 4GWh
Major new Tesla product line -- not a car -- will be unveiled at our Hawthorne Design Studio on Thurs 8pm, April 30
Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever.
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater, noisy, grounded in bad weather
Contrary to press reports, I'm not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons.
Reading Look to Windward by Banks. He is an amazing writer. Pantheon level.
@AbeAlem Unfortunately, Asimov's books largely illustrate why the three laws don't work
Another Easter Egg will be hidden in the Model S code in 2015. Last one took a year to find. Next one should be easier.
@Pandoomic Just changed them to full public domain
However, when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars, the public may outlaw the latter. Hopefully not.
To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.
Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future, though, for non-commercial traffic.
Neither I nor the company are selling shares. Even if we were, I wouldn't do this. It would be wrong. Our long term results are what matter.
Some people seem to think I tweet to affect share price. This is false. A brief rise in $TSLA stock obviously does no good for Tesla or me.
The ancient Egyptians were amazing, but if aliens built the pyramids, they would've left behind a computer or something
The rumor that I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet Mars is totally untrue
Btw, please don't mention the pyramids. Stacking stone blocks is not evidence of an advanced civilization.
Seems like an opportune moment to bring up the Fermi Paradox, aka "where are the aliens?" Really odd that we see no sign of them.
There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway, as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It's not subtle.
Upgrades in the works to allow landing for geo missions: thrust +15%, deep cryo oxygen, upper stage tank vol +10%
Both satellites deployed on target. Now firing their ion thrusters to reach geo station over Europe and; Asia.
Next landing attempt will be 3rd launch from now. Tonight's flight and following one will not have enough propellant.
Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target and; nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
@DanielLockyer We could actually do that...maybe we should
Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)
Can't delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.
Mega storm preventing droneship from remaining on station, so rocket will try to land on water. Survival probability &lt;1%.
Launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the Cape, but Dragon still inbound from orbit in 90 mins
Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes 
Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have).
Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles, 4X further than moon.
P85 acceleration will also improve, but not quite as much
Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm
Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.
And pls don't ask me about space elevatorsuntil someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge
Reason is Newton's Third Law. In vacuum, there is nothing to "push" against. You must react against ejected mass.
If u saw @TheSimpsons and wonder why @SpaceX doesn't use an electric rocket to reach orbit, it is cuz that is impossible
@Extinction_OPS: We're losing species faster than we can count. Join #RacingExtinction in the race to stop the next mass extinction.ht
West Coast droneship under construction will be named "Of Course I Still Love You"
Repairs almost done on the spaceport drone ship and have given it the name "Just Read the Instructions"
Next rocket landing on drone ship in 2 to 3 weeks w way more hydraulic fluid. At least it shd explode for a diff reason.
@ID_AA_Carmack Tks. Turns out we recovered some impact video frames from drone ship. It's kinda begging to be released
@FormulaSAE Contact Steve Davis at Hyperloop@spacex.com
Will be building a Hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods. Most likely in Texas.
@hitaskunk: @elonmusk First question asked of AI; "Is there a god?" First AI answer; "There is now"
@alankerlin Hydraulics are usually closed, but that adds mass vs short acting open systems. F9 fins only work for 4 mins. We were ~10% off.
Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...
Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho.
Ascent phase good. Dragon deployed to Space Station rendezvous orbit.
At mission control in California. Launch in 60 mins. Looks good so far.
Need to investigate the upper stage Z actuator. Was behaving strangely. Next launch attempt on Friday at 5am.
Btw, we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall and; connects like a solid metal snake. For realz.
Reading The Culture series by Banks. Compelling picture of a grand, semi-utopian galactic future. Hopefully not too optimistic about AI.
Roadster upgrade will enable non-stop travel from LA to SF -- almost 400 mile range. Details tmrw. Merry Christmas!
Nothing against all the oatmeal-raisin cookies out there. Just be yourself.
Really should be a rule that oatmeal-raisin cookies can't look too much like choc chip. Doppelg cookie trickery!
Pack swap now operating in limited beta mode for SF to LA route. Can swap battery faster than visiting a gas station. Tesla blog out soon.
Falcon/Dragon launch punted to early Jan. Need time to review all systems thoroughly again.
Dune series by Herbert also brilliant. He advocates placing limits on machine intelligence.
Welcome back @RicardoR to run the @TeslaMotors communications team!
@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign and; more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yawithroll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel and; rocket flyback in future.
Really hate it when companies bring out an awesome show car and then you can never actually buy it. So lame.
Rumors about canceling Falcon wing doors are false. At Tesla, the production car will always be better than the show car.
@Shmizer1 unfettered certainly and at very low cost
SpaceX is still in the early stages of developing advanced micro-satellites operating in large formations. Announcement in 2 to 3 months.
Deepest sympathies to the families of the pilots and the Virgin Galactic team
Sorry to hear about the @OrbitalSciences launch. Hope they recover soon.
Also, lease price improvement is due to US Bank deal. It is *not* a discount. Revenue to Tesla is unchanged.
Article in @WSJ re Tesla sales is incorrect. September was a record high WW and up 65% year-over-year in North America.
Was going to work out this morning. Went to IHOP instead.
Kinda trippy seeing myself on @SouthPark. I've watched the show ever since the J vs SC short. Brian Boitano!
Just got word that the cumulative miles of theworldwide Tesla fleet passed half a billion!
I love the Internet. Comments had me literally ROFL. No, it wasn't intentional. Glad I didn't mention the other letter!
Calendar app w tap to nav and; traffic predictor in Tesla V6.0 release will radically improve how the car adapts to the owner over time
Would also like to congratulate @Boeing, fellow winner of the @NASA commercial crew program
Deeply honored and appreciative of the trust that @NASA has placed in @SpaceX for the future of human spaceflight
Official Gigafactory address to be: Electric Avenue, McCarran, Nevada
@yoshimasa_satoh It was exactly what I was looking for
@evanwiththebig @TeslaMotors Expansion to Madrid already underway. Map is being updated. All of Spain and; Portugal by end of 2015.
Model S limits torque if brake and; accel simul pressed. Going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety hazard.
@cermak @Tesla_Europe I agree. We are fixing this plan. Updated map coming soon.
@WillOremus That has been my goal from the beginning. Need the Gigafactory for Model 3.
Three engine F9R Dev1 vehicle auto-terminated during test flight. No injuries or near injuries. Rockets are tricky 
@awadsayeed Yes. Technically Model 3 or maybe three horizontal bars. Won't be three vertical bars.
@BillGates @RyanSeacrest @TEDchris Am a bit under the weather, but will do it!
High velocity reentry (2700 lbs/sqft) appeared to succeed, but, as expected, not enough propellant to land for this and the next mission.
Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable
While on the subject of AI risk, Our Final Invention by @jrbarrat is also worth reading
@drwave @itsDanielSuarez Yeah, Daemon is a great read
@IrrelevantGamer @masseffect Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games ever. Also love Saints Row IV.
Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.
Guardians of the Galaxy is great. Best line is when Star-Lord says his spaceship looks like a Jackson Pollock painting under black light.
On annual camping trip w kids. Trying a place just south of Carmel in California this year.
Looks like body slam, maybe from a self-generated wave
Detailed review of rocket telemetry needed to tell if due to initial splashdown or subsequent tip over and body slam
Rocket booster reentry, landing burn and; leg deploy were good, but lost hull integrity right after splashdown (aka kaboom)
Flight 10 of Falcon 9 was good. All six ORBCOMM satellites deployed on target.
@leroytwin @Tesla_Canada A lot of Canadian Superchargers are in work and will start going live in the next month or so
Goal is for unsubsidized solar power to cost less than grid electricity from coal or fracked gas
Edmunds beats Tesla LA-NY record by several hours! @edmunds: Made it! Our Model S made LA-NY run in 67 hrs and 21 mins"
Apparently, lots of confused media inquiries about blog title. Look, we just to make sure they don't set us up the bomb.
@thkyv: @elonmusk 399 EV`s in World Record breaking parade in Bryne, Norway today. 100+ Teslas!
@QuantumG When we launch I want to know that SpaceX has done everything possible to keep the astronauts safe. Only a few more years to go.
@QuantumG Dragon V1.1 doesn't have a launch escape system. Probably comparable reliability to Shuttle, but we need to do better.
@RichardGarriott Just the air in Dragon. Technically, if a few humans had stowed aboard Dragon on the last flight, they would've been ok.
@westcoastbill First, the cheese. Then, the mouse.
Reason I believe this is likely is that Correll first tried to work at SpaceX, but we turned him down. Our competitor, it seems, did not.
V likely AF official Correll was told by ULA/Rocketdyne that a rich VP job was his if he gave them a sole source contract
@Oatmeal may all technology in the future follow the zeroth law...
Worth seeing @ChefTheFilm by @Jon_Favreau. Make sure to plan for a meal afterwards!
Cover drops on May 29. Actual flight design hardware of crew Dragon, not a mockup.
Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed
@KAlHomoud Superchargers in Canada will go live in 6 to 8 weeks. Update on forums shortly.
Flight computers continued transmitting for 8 seconds after reaching the water. Stopped when booster went horizontal.
Data upload from tracking plane shows landing in Atlantic was good! Several boats enroute through heavy seas.
@MarinaSBlinova Rocket boost stage reaching 0 m/s in one piece :) Will know soon. Odds not high.
Last known state for rocket boost stage is 360 m/s, Mach 1.1, 8.5 km altitude and roll rate close to zero (v important!)
Orbit insertion and Dragon deploy all good. Falcon reentry burn also good. Waiting for landing data from tracking plane.
@erwinEmm Need to make sure precision return from hypersonic velocity works in ocean before transitioning to land
This is 1st ever orbital rocket launch w landing legs. Will attempt leg deploy and; soft landing out to sea.
@elonmusk Also, breakfast at Tesla is self-serve cereal (no distinction for execs) and the person mentioned isn't actually an employee
Leasing a Model S takes 5 mins online, no signatures and; one tap on car center screen to accept when delivered
@AKAbrahamson @itsDanielSuarez Yeah, that's worth a read
@MarinaSBlinova @MikeJudge @Recode That would definitely help
@justincooperman @MikeJudge @Recode Yeah, that about sums it up
Bloomberg article today also has oddly false details. I don't eat breakfast at Tesla and drink coffee, not juice.
The @MikeJudge show about Silicon Valley missed the mark in some ways, but I didn't hate it, as @Recode reporter claimed
@OlejAndersen Once 5.9 is rolled out to the whole fleet and all looks good, we will roll out 6.0 to owners on our public beta program
@OlejAndersen Some challenges w 5.9 rollout, as it contains software specially written for car owners in Norway and; Belgium
Working on a Model S environmental impact blog this weekend to counteract BS like the @Bloomberg graphite story. Beyond ridiculous...
@jnags92 Yes, I'm confident that Tesla will do something with them.
@TeamAizek Not true. The amount of graphite in our car is small, comes from Japan and is mined in a very clean way.
@X4NWO Well, now that Satoshi Nakamoto has been discovered, I guess it is case closed ... :)

However, F9 will continue to land in the ocean until we prove precision control from hypersonic thru subsonic regimes
Tesla V6 software upload coming soon. Need to make sure it is "awesome" - Lord Business
Saw The Lego Movie earlier today. Brilliant writing and humor! Loved the "Everything is awesome..." theme song.
Tesla LA to NY Supercharger rally just completed in 76 hours across northern route in dead of winter thru heavy snow!
Two teams from Tesla aiming to set a cross-country EV speed record this week. Departing Fri from LA, arriving Sun in NY.
Will be doing the LA-NY family road trip over Spring Break. Made everyone watch National Lampoon's Vacation as prep.
Tesla Supercharger network now energized from New York to LA, both coast + Texas! Approx 80% of US population covered.
@SpaceX: Falcon 9 has successfully deployed THAICOM 6 into its target orbit
@westcoastbill Thanks Bill! Sure is a great start to 2014 :)
@olajahr @TeslaMotors Ideally, the S should just hold position when it knows that's what you really want
@bonnienorman @TeslaMotors @TeslaMotorsClub Merry Christmas!
@simonhackett Yes, definitely needs a huge amount of battery capacity. ~1/3 of energy produced during day must be stored
Rest in peace, Nelson Mandela. A man both good and great.
Should mention that the battery cells used for this are 200 Wh/kg vs 250 for Model S. No short term supply constraint.
Restart was good, apogee raised to 80k km (50k miles). Yes!!!
Reached parking orbit. Now coasting towards equator, where the upper stage will, if all goes well, restart to raise apogee
About an hour away from launch. I'd like to thank @SES_Satellites for taking a chance on @SpaceX. We've given it our all.
@Jon_Favreau: An Amazon drone just flew away with my dog.
@TierraUniversu It was fixed this weekend, so he should try the test again.
@TierraUniversu The writer of this article had a problem with his 12V battery, so main pack was constantly charging it.
@TierraUniversu Doesn't sound right. If it is, we certainly need to fix it. Investigating...
All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower and; weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.
@lomac92 @WIRED No, almost all fuel/ox is being reserved for SES satellite to give max chance of success
Don't actually mean to knock Honda -- their cars are solid -- but the park outside (or yr house might burn down) advice was awesome
@AdamMKE Model S can seat 5 adults, two kids and has a front trunk for luggage. Might work for you.
@williamwinters: Ford issues 4th and 5th recalls for 2013 Escapes spontaneously catching fire. Not in the mainstream media. @elonmusk ht
Saw pressure fluctuations on Falcon boost stage liquid oxygen tank. Want to be super careful, so pushing launch to Thurs.
At Disney World w kids for traditional prelaunch visit (first good flight was after riding Space Mountain)
@DarkSapiens Easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. Done in order to reduce satellite side delta V from 1800 m/s to 1500 m/s.
Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80,000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon).
Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than 100,000 gas car fires that kill 100s of people per year?
In other news, George Clooney reports that his iPhone 1 had a bug back in '07
Thanks Woz! "@stevewoz: Here to pick up my new car! (at @TeslaMotors with 2 others)"
@DebbieViviers @SpaceX Yes, upper stage venting of liquid oxygen created a fast moving fuzzy white sphere in space over SA
Between this flight and; Grasshopper tests, I think we now have all the pieces of the puzzle to bring the rocket back home.
Rocket booster relit twice (supersonic retro and; landing), but spun up due to aero torque, so fuel centrifuged and; we flamed out
Looks good for a launch attempt today. Upper winds slightly exceed loads in high subsonic regime, but improving.
Falcon 9 launch window is Sunday and Monday, assuming good weather at Vandenberg Air Force Base
Am happy to hear that GM plans to develop an affordable 200 mile range electric car. Right target. Hope others do same.
Approach is 360 deg flush mounted tiny cameras + radar (prob not lidar). Lot of software and; hardware level image processing.
Engineers interested in working on autonomous driving, pls email autopilot@teslamotors.com. Team will report directly to me.
Intense effort underway at Tesla to develop a practical autopilot system for Model S
Will do another static fire of rocket to make sure all is good and; AF needs to test ICBMs, so probable launch Sept 29/30.
Full thrust achieved on 2 sec static fire. Some anomalies to be investigated, so launch date tbd.
It is crazy that the proposed California high speed rail only goes 200 mph w avg speed of 130 mph when Japan is 300 mph+
@Jon_Favreau Yup. We saw it in the movie and made it real. Good idea!
Will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures and; then immediately printing it in titanium
And, uhh no (zillionth person who asked), I am not going to make an IM suit, however design by hand-manipulated hologram is actually useful.
We figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high frame rate holograph generator.
Btw, this is not the very latest version. Will post an updated version with several late arriving corrections in a few hours.
Pulled all nighter working on Hyperloop (as did others). Hopefully not too many mistakes. Will publish link at 1:30 PDT.
One of the first Tesla Supercharger stations in Europe is being built in Cinderella, Norway #KatieWoodencloak
Best saying ever @temochdez: there is a saying in Mexico: "El miedo no anda en burro" meaning "Fear doesn't ride on a donkey"
@UberObvi: It gets dark when the sun goes down.
@John_Gardi your guess is the closest I've seen anyone guess so far. Pod diameter probably around 2m
@schadlu I really hate patents unless critical to company survival. Will publish Hyperloop as open source.
@TobiasVdb Yes, it is a purely propulsive landing, but using the huge landing gear A frames as air brakes. Landing prop &lt; 5% of vehicle mass
Will publish Hyperloop alpha design by Aug 12. Critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated.
Just completed full mission duration firing of next gen Falcon 9 booster. V proud of the boost stage team for overcoming many tough issues.
@BrianDunning @SpaceX New spacesuit almost done. Hoping to unveil by end of year.
So true @jlgolson: BitTorrent packet goes to a bar and asks for beer. Everyone in the bar who already has a beer gives him a sip.
TCP packet walks into a bar and; says  like a beer. Barman replies  like a beer? , replies TCP packet, like a beer.
Woohoo, Tesla direct sales petition passed the 100k threshold! Thanks a lot to everyone that helped!!
Have been reading about Henry Fielding, who had the most excellent pen name of Captain Hercules Vinegar
One learns something new every day @UberFacts: A  is an actual measurement of volume - Equal to 126 gallons.
@lougil_ace Taking action. Will be a 7 day grace period for $2500 ext warranty. Neg margin at that price, so must unfortunately raise.
@John_Gardi: @elonmusk You should point out this campaign wasn't started by TM but by concerned citizens that want a fair deal and; a futur
@arthurblake Turning recirc off, windows closed and the right film on rear glass usually works. Am asking HVAC engineering to investigate.
@arthurblake Tesla service can do coating or can be done by any auto glass coating company. My car is done on side and; rear
@arthurblake Turn off AC recirc, so that cool air flows out thru rear vents and; get IR coating on rear glass.
@LisaRoutel The NY auto dealers lost in court, so now they are funding a bill in NY legislature to block Tesla
Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars, past and present. It was always there.
@zatulsky Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap), but the technology is not.
Video of battery pack swap will be posted to the Tesla website around 9:30pm, so those attending will see this first.
Live pack swap demo on Thurs night at 8pm California time at our design studio in Hawthorne. Seeing is believing.
Battery storage of solar power needed for night operation and; to buffer grid during day. Beta projects are going well.
Easier said than done. There is a lot of pressure from investors. It is hard not to feel super bad if u don't make ur qtr.
Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+, but market cares about next 3 months. Result would be conflicting priorities.
No near term plans to IPO @SpaceX. Only possible in very long term when Mars Colonial Transporter is flying regularly.
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Vac thrust of 700 tons means avg of 14 tons/floor of structural steel for a 50 story building.
@williamricci6 50% higher. ~1.3 M lbs sea level and ~1.5 M lbs vacuum thrust. Will be 60% higher with some tweaks.
@RobertGaristo V much agree. Moreover, there is risk of severe non-linearities in feedback loops causing sudden warming.
@RobertGaristo: @elonmusk I'm a physicist and; 97% # seems right rare to find a scientist not convinced by evidence, and; ~none think there 
Am thinking of doing a movie "sequel" of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet
Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.
Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost and; shift to sustainable energy
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety
Climate change deniers claim "scientists disagree", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades
@UberFacts: There's an Iron Man edition of Mr. Potato Head named "Tony Starch."
Was beat up pretty badly as a kid and; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix.
Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting :)
Sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside
@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension and; mega torque.
Technically, I "got rich" from Zip2 and; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla and; SolarCity.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods and; critical meds.
@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me and; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good and; disincent bad.
@VarunG_ Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
@tonykatz Don't like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history.
@SapientCapital We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't.
And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?
As many have already noted, @Chrysler is a division of Fiat, an Italian company. We specifically said first *US* company.
@yes_andre I'm a big fan of ultracapacitors. Was going to do my PhD at Stanford on them. But we need a breakthrough in energy density...
@McBartVolgers @SpaceX High pressure helium pneumatic bolts and pistons. No explosives.
@TalulahRiley You're welcome. It did seem like the chicken of destiny xx
Petting zoo left a chicken behind at the park. Now we have a pet chicken.
@DanaBrunetti Soon Model S will feature druidic dwarves dancing around a miniature stone henge
@DanaBrunetti Well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :)
Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week.
@bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. Worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history.
@vicorly Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S
@itsokayyouknow Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change
Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon and; Peter Rive and; their awesome team. I'm just a small part.
@SeanChin @RaimisJ Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
@annabananastand It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
@enggirl Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something.
@JasonPolstein Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately.
@RaimisJ Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote and; others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later)
@dpinsen People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way.
Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python.
Hold down voice button and; say "Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic". Model S can play almost any song via Internet.
@realbhuwan Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.
There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
@HowardReiter Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
Just want to say thanks to customers and; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you.
Am a fan of Larry, Sergey and; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here
Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle and; truck
Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production.
@DJFrustration Tested it myself this weekend and was working well. Some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request.
Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!
@bdcs Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars.
@nirdthebird Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places.
@DouglasBullard @teslamotors Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
@flyguynscc @teslamotors yes, that has been the goal from the beginning
@fink_justin It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother
@WehbyJammin Earnings call next week, then Supercharger week after and then... the mystery announcement/demonstration :)
@thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
@Rocco_TheStreet Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
@ChrisCowan_Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
@stoneymonster Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.
@yatpay Side boosters fall short and; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee witho restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway.
@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
@rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better.
@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
@darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
@JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
@BigBalli High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
@roulezelectric This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part 4 yet.
Time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). Tesla announcement tomorrow.
@astrostephenson We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same
@MelissaMontoyaO Anne's role is launch site engineering. Don't think she has anything against media -- just not her role.
@RealTomLangel Maybe a v long time from now. Paying div is a sign that a company cannot find good ways to spend money.
@wfww Our software is requesting the right song, but Slacker has a bug in their code. Supposed to be fixed by tomorrow.
Congrats to @VirginGalactic and @RichardBranson on supersonic test flight!
@tcmeggs Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the 405 look fast.
@tcmeggs This argument is a bit silly. A city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't traffic.
@NycomWireless @TeslaMotors Cool, thanks for buying our car!
@Tapp697 Thanks, important clarification. Tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. Market follows eventually.
Announcement of new @TeslaMotors strategy tomorrow. Tesla owners will like this.
Seems to be some stormy weather over in Shortville these days
@Rocketrichardp @ct_la Exactly. DMV Comm overruled good recommendation of Hearing Officer.
@Trekker56 @TeslaMotors Please contact DMV Commissioner and Governor. This is not good for the people of Virginia.
Not all good news. Virginia DMV Commissioner just denied Tesla a dealer license, despite Hearing Officer being in favor.
@In_Sight_Full @juliewestfall we have great neighbors!
@dbhyslop Will post a video of the latest Grasshopper flight tomorrow (taken from the camera on our new hexacopter).
Cool picture of Io crossing Jupiter sent to me by @shervin. Would be amazing to visit in person one day.
@eirene_inc @archforhumanity @AFHDisasterTeam We have a lot of heavy lifting equipment. Will ask my team to send it over.
Heart goes out to people of central Texas, home of SpaceX TX. All resources at disposal to help in any way.
@batasrki Stay tuned for a big Supercharger announcement in a few weeks. Definitely have you covered.
@JBSiegelMD Thanks! Hearing from constituents is super important to counteract the influence of the dealer lobby.
New York judge states: "... dealers cannot utilize the Franchised Dealer Act as a means to sue their competitors". Exactly!
New York judge just ruled in favor Tesla, dismissing the legal attack by auto dealers to prevent direct sales!
Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in Austin. Will hang around after press conf to thank people in person.
@derrickgott007 already partly here with rocket development, but will make it a lot bigger with the launch site
Just had Texas BBQ for lunch in Capitol Building. About to head to House Committee hearing to advocate for Tesla in TX.
Which leads me to my next subject of gun control ... just kidding
No more political comments for me now that I've shot off both my feet.
@TaniaPalme When a person dies, the right thing to do is remember the good more than the bad. Not a day for hate (if there is ever such).
At the risk of losing more "cool points", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton and; JFK. Good people on both sides...
@ticeestes Am not trying to accumulate cool points. She was far from perfect, but her actions, on balance, were good.
@richardmatthias Her later years are debatable, but her early years are not imo. Britain went from dreary to Great again.
@ryanjoyce88 We went through literally hundreds of variants of red trying to find something original that didn't suck.
@quietlybear Do all the intro courses for mech, EE, aero and physics, then specialize in the one you like most.
@sightalignment Hoping to open the Century City Tesla store this month. It is my neighborhood mall, so I'm there all the time.
@fleijerstam @gronnbilnorge We are working hard to make that happen!
@BjarteReve Should be late 2014 for US and early 2015 for Europe.
Am headed to TX next week to thank people personally for supporting Tesla. Please head to SB 1659 @ 8am tomorrow #TeslaTX
@TeslaMotors: Texas auto dealers want to stop Tesla from selling, delivering, and; servicing cars. Senate hearing for SB 1659 is @ 8 ...
Certainly true that many people believe that Tesla and SpaceX are powered by the #hhgttg Infinite Improbability Drive :)
Today's Tesla announcement is actually the 2nd in a 5 part trilogy (love Douglas Adams)
@stopman Thanks Michael. Beauty of over the air software updates is that the product keeps improving even after you buy it.
@jeremys Thanks Jeremy! Good seeing you in LA. Awesome job with Yelp!
To be clear, Tesla is in California, so it is not April Fool's yet! Also, some may differ, but imo the Tues news is arguably more important.
About to do chocolate egg hunt with all the kids. Candy bonanza! Happy Easter!
A123 battery company renames itself B456 after bankruptcy (really).
Recovery ship has secured Dragon. Powering down all secondary systems. Cargo looks A ok.
Telemetry says main parachutes deployed ... now visually confirmed
Recovery ship just heard the sonic booms from Dragon reentry and has data transmission lock.
Dragon deorbit burn was good. All thrusters operating. On target for splashdown.
Slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions -- will be Tues next week.
Really exciting @TeslaMotors announcement coming on Thursday. Am going to put my money where my mouth is in v major way.
@MichaelLindahl It will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. Think Audi A4 or BMW 3 vs Model S being S7 or M5
.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride
.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
.@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner.
@malkosh was this in a test drive car (those are all about to be upgraded) or a current customer car?
@Anthropic Yeah, Plum Brook Space Power Facility @NASA Glenn Research Center. Help from the Glenn team much appreciated.
Will show Johnny Cash hover slam rocket video for the first time in about 15 mins. Test footage only 36 hrs old. #SXSW
Check out Model S at Tesla Austin Gallery at The Domain opening today! I will stop by this eve and tomorrow morning.
@RebeccaJarvis Not yet. I look forward to giving that a try.
Random trivia: my grandfather and; great grandfather were both born in Minnesota. I was named after my GGF.
Minnesota auto dealers tried to pass legislation to block Tesla stores. Bill was just defeated in Senate. Thanks MN!
@Asherlaw SpaceX is expanding launch ops at Canaveral too. Need 2 locations to handle flight rate and avoid weather risk
Arrived Austin. Talking with TX House about creating an orbital launch complex near Brownsville, then #SXSW keynote tmrw
@navidob Pretty much. Couldn't leave the country of Ibsen without doing something cultural!
Am in Oslo to thank the Norwegian customers of @TeslaMotors personally. Highest Model S orders per capita in the world.
Just received #Dragon docking clearance from @NASA. Will begin orbital maneuvers to Space Station at 11pm Pacific time.
Would also like to thank @USAirForce for allowing us to use their long range comm system for Dragon in free drift.
Just want to say thanks to @NASA for being the world's coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods!
Orbit raising burn successful. Dragon back on track.
Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green.
Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!
Thruster pod 3 tank pressure trending positive. Preparing to deploy solar arrays.
About to pass over Australia ground station and command inhibit override
Holding on solar array deployment until at least two thruster pods are active
Issue with Dragon thruster pods. System inhibiting three of four from initializing. About to command inhibit override.
Falcon 9 delivered Dragon to its target orbit. All good on the rocket.
Computer glitch found by @SpaceX avionics while bench testing on IM. Couldn't replicate on vehicle. Launch proceeding...
Launch on track for tomorrow morning at 10:10 am Cape Canaveral time
@Edmunds_Test: About to head home in our 2013 @Teslamotors Model S. I won't plug in at home for the return trip. I'll take side trips ...
@andrewliebchen @_chrissimmons Exactly. Then no need for clean energy subsidies, as externality is priced into mkt behavior
@_ChrisSimmons A carbon tax would affect coal even more than gasoline, so electricity would also become more expensive
Rocket static fire @SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch pad looks good. Engines generated 433 tons of thrust, parameters nominal.
@FaeLoba Best is winning competitions like Formula SAE, design/build/fly or other evidence of exceptional eng ability
@EricIdle Cool! Btw, thought you might appreciate that 1st flight of Dragon spacecraft carried a large wheel of cheese :)

Btw, more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge, v high speed trip and; long detours, like NYTimes drive.
@batasrki Yeah, Top Gear pretended the Tesla Roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. Logs showed 50 miles range left.
@tomleykis Thanks Tom! Support of real Tesla customers like yourself who drive the car every day is v much appreciated.
Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media.
Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes "range test". Also lining up other journalists to do same drive.
NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max and; took a long detour.
Next Grasshopper rocket test is called the Johnny Cash Hover Slam (yeah baby!). Might be our first smoking crater...
Great spirit here in the Superdome. Awesome rally by the @49ers!! #SB47
Desire to help Boeing is real and; am corresponding w 787 chief engineer. Junod's Esquire article had high fiction content.
Maybe already under control, but Tesla and; SpaceX are happy to help with the 787 lithium ion batteries.
To be super clear, I don't wish to (nor could I) mandate anything about a Mars Colony. Am just working on the tech to get people there.
CA's Death Valley is #1 again! Tesla hot weather testing was done there. Model S was fine but gas tow truck overheated.
@KarlSchroeder Interesting premise. I will read it.
Thanks! @ev: Have driven a Tesla Model S 50 miles now. It's clearly the iPhone of cars far the best car ever made."
@prbowman Roughly equivalent to a 747 flight from LA to London (one way).
@ImprobableToad That's why I'm a believer in solar power. We have a giant fusion reactor conveniently located in the sky.
Exactly MT "@DanRetz IMHO: continuing the uncontrolled experiment of adding co2 to atmosphere is a bad idea.
@Neowolf2 Relative to kerosene, methane is not prone to coking, but we would run v high purity anyway for max Isp.
My big worry would be long (hopefully) term when I'm dead, eg v sad situation with once great HP@TEA_in_Space
SpaceX will go public at some point, as I think it should ultimately be owned primarily by the public "@bm_ will SpaceX go public?"
@IntlManOfRealty Best to study some form of engineering, which is the art of creating useful things that didn't exist before.
Tesla was just approved for a full Class 1 Massachusetts Auto Sales License by a vote of 4 to 1. Much appreciated!
Told my kids (age 8 and 6) that we were going to see the Nutcracker, which somehow got translated as the Buttcracker.
Congrats to @dmetcalf for being the first to drive a Tesla Model S over 400 miles on a single charge!
Am happy to report that Tesla was narrowly cash flow positive last week. Continued improvement expected through year end.
But if humanity wishes to become a multi-planet species, then we must figure out how to move millions of people to Mars.
And, yes, I do in fact know that this sounds crazy. That is not lost on me. Nor I do think SpaceX will do this alone.
@cthorm SS Heart of Gold powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive!
@YOUSRC Amos's article was fair, but his editor chose a more sensational headline and; used quotes even though I didn't actually say that.
Was misquoted by BBC as saying "Europe's rocket has no chance". Just said the [Franco-German] Ariane 5 has no chance, so go with Ariane 6.
Just returned from a trip to London and Oxford, where I met with many interesting people. I really like Britain!

Reply to @Astro_yyz: Yes, Model S seats 5 adults + 2 kids with room for luggage in the front trunk. My kids love the rear facing seats best.

Neil Armstrong was a hero to all of humanity. His spirit will carry us to the stars.
About to go through my first jury selection process. Trial concerns an alleged gang related murder. Hardcore.
@SpaceX: Success! Congrats @NASA on @MarsCuriosity!
@JustBe74 V important to make all of humanity proud, but in this case a particular duty is owed to the American taxpayer
Deeply appreciate @NASA's faith in @SpaceX. We will do whatever it takes to make NASA and the American people proud.
@UrgentSpeed Sure. To be clear that number would include all US solar energy (thermal+PV).
1st pure solar gigawatt hour day just achieved by @SolarCity! Predict 1st terawatt hour day from all US solar &lt; 15 years.
@bryanwolfnow I'm neither anti-conservative nor anti-liberal. Just don't like group think. Ideas should be considered on their own merits.
@dansitu Individuals set the vector for the tides. The Life of Brian points out that we are all individuals, except for that one guy.
People ought to think more about who wrote the software that's running in their head (sigh). It probably wasn't them.
@DJjodes Would love to make a Tesla supertruck with crazy torque, dynamic air suspension and corners like its on rails. That'd be sweet...
@patrickdorey81 Model S starts at $50k after federal rebate. Gen3 will be ~$30k. Need to optimize design and scale volume.
Goal for Model S is to show that electric is way way better than gas. Combine w solar power and; the future looks bright.
Worth noting that Muller's research confirming global warming is real was funded by Koch. Fate loves irony.
@walalm Yes, my absolute goal w Tesla has always been mass market electric cars. Will finally get there with Gen3 program.
@nopev Biggest risk is that we take too long to solve the sustainable energy problem, causing climate change meltdown.
Compared to past, today's world is fantastic and; likely will be for many decades. Just need to cover future downside risk.
@iproducefodrake Asimov's Foundationpoints out that all civilizations fall. Must ensure dark period is short and; finite.

Will publish something on the Hyperloop in about four weeks. Will forgo patents on the idea and just open source it. Not a vac tunnel btw.

Going at full speed! MT @iansomerhalder: Elon- you are my hero my friend.Please!Ramp up production on cars that use NO gas."
Now back to work. Intense months ahead as we ramp production of rockets and cars.
Am standing on the beach in Maui and looking at a moon rainbow for the first time in my life. Incredibly beautiful.
After 2008 meltdown, vacation for me just meant email with a view, but SpaceX and; Tesla are now strong enough that I can make it real (yay!!)

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - Arthur C Clarke. Thanks for the quote, RIP.
While in Austin, had a great time doing a cameo in @rodriguez latest movie, Machete Kills. Cool studio on old airport.
Splashdown successful!! Sending fast boat to Dragon lat/long provided by P3 tracking planes #Dragon
Thrusters will also fire during reentry to adjust touchdown point. Next version will land w helicopter precision #Dragon
Spaceship has departed from the International Space Station. Firing thrusters to deorbit in ~30 mins #Dragon
The head of the Russian Space Agency and some Russian diplomats are visiting @SpaceX today. Looking forward to meeting.
@NASA: The @SpaceX #Dragon capsule passed directly below the #ISS at a distance of 2.5km, fulfilling all demonstration objectives for ...
About 110 miles away and the spacecraft is now in direct communication with the Space Station #Dragon
The President just called to say congrats. Caller ID was blocked, so at first I thought it was a telemarketer :)
Dragon fly by of Space Station planned for 12:47 am California time. All systems green. #dragonlaunch
Navigation bay pointing to deep space and star map being generated by star tracker one. Yes! #DragonLaunch
Dragon spaceship opens the navigation pod bay door without hesitation. So much nicer than HAL9000 :) #DragonLaunch
Also big thanks to the Air Force, FAA and all of our partners for their support of this mission.
Huge appreciation for @NASA, without whom we could not even have started, let alone reached this far.
Falcon flew perfectly!! Dragon in orbit, comm locked and solar arrays active!! Feels like a giant weight just came off my back :)
T minus 60 seconds. Terminal autosequence initiated. #DragonLaunch
T minus 10 minutes ... Entering terminal count #dragonlaunch
Major Tesla milestone: All crash testing is complete for 5* (max) safety rating. Cars can now be built for sale to public!
Simulations show launch ok with bad valve. Still, better to stop and; fix. Recalling rockets after launch is not an option.
Launch aborted: slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine 5. Will adjust limits for countdown in a few days.
Whatever happens today, we could not have done it without @NASA, but errors are ours alone and me most of all.
Must remember not to refer to Chimpanzees as deadly killing machines when taking little kids to see a movie about them
... which is the critical breakthrough needed for life to become multiplanetary.
Making large scale rocket propulsion landing work well is a critical step towards a fully reusable Mars transport system
Meant to say: prizes for first 10 who do 400 miles in Tesla witho recharging, not nonstop, which would require diapers :)
Saw The Dictator yesterday. Reminded me of Putin's reelection. Seems like only yesterday since he was last in power.
@geoffeg Dragon code is written in C++ on Linux.
Almost done reviewing Dragon code with @NASA. Looks good so far. Target launch date is May 19, right after Soyuz docks.
For humanity to have an exciting and; inspiring future, we cannot be confined to Earth forever. @love_to_dream #APSpaceChat
Definitely. Long term goal of SpaceX making life multiplanetary. #OccupyMars @Weaverwerx #APSpaceChat

Woohoo, rocket hold down firing completed and all looks good!!
Am excited to announce that SolarCity has filed for an IPO. Mission is to bring affordable solar power to the people!
Just confirmed with @NASA that May 7th is go for launch of Falcon 9 and; Dragon to the Space Station
Am pushing launch back approx a week to do more testing on Dragon docking code. New date pending coordination with @NASA.
Just completed the rocket rollout review at SpaceX HQ in California. Almost time to launch. Pucker factor increasing...
In NYC for the premiere of Baseball in the Time of @Cholera. Great work by @brynmooser and @daviddarg!

Great to meet Jon Stewart this eve. Have been a fan of @TheDailyShow for a billion years.
Friend told me about the amazing work of Brazilian plastic surgeon Evil Picante. He was actually saying Ivo Pitanguy.
Besides ensuring the continuance of life, creating a base on Mars would be the most exciting adventure ever!
Also dig Mass Effect. It's all fun & games until the AI decides people suck. Maybe we can be their limbic system.
Bioshock is an Ayn Rand dystopia and Fallout New Vegas is a Hegelian dialectic. Games have come a long way since Pong.
The Model S beta endurance car just passed 150,000 miles on a single battery pack!
@TeslaMotors: "Tesla represents the most extreme test in modern history of the limits and capabilities of the Silicon Valley model."...
If something is physically possible, not only is someone doing it, but there is also an award show.
Mountain lions eat cats, which means we *actually* live in a cat eat cat world ... an apology is owed to dogkind!
I think if you go there, they just feed you delicious candy all day and ask nothing in return.
@TomMao1 Studied physics in college, read a lot of books and was taught by the world's leading domain experts at SpaceX.
@LooperNor Yes, this will, if all goes well, be the first commercial spaceship to dock with the Space Station. T zero ~ end of April.
Supporting the drive to get a #PlutoStamp for the @NASA New Horizons mission
Do not search for purple squirrels! Giving them attention only makes them want to be more purple.
@TeslasBigFan Don't worry, we've got a cool solution for ski storage on the X with the Falcon wing doors
Btw, Foster the People is playing the Model X event tonight. Seemed like the right vibe.
Russia and China are blocking UN action. Can't imagine why they wouldn't support a democratic uprising...
@BenToBeWild Yes, we will unveil a fully functional advanced prototype of the Model X -- almost identical to production.
The sheer size of Falcon Heavy is mind-blowing. It could literally send a fully loaded London bus to the moon.
@MacDeviant Yeah, we will stream the whole mission realtime with no buffer. You see what we see.
Um, while awesome in its own way, that was not actually the SpaceX theme song. It seems that irony is sometimes lost in a tweet.
Design completed for bringing rocket back to launchpad using only thrusters. Yay. Wings r just dead weight in space.
Bought some wood and built a little treehouse with my boys. Few more beautiful ways to spend an afternoon.
@TheOnion I heard Lars von Trier optioned the movie rights
That said, even though they cause me grief, I would defend the right of shorts to exist. They are often unreasonably maligned.
Will communicate better in the future. Too many people want us to fail and are willing to twist any bit of news against Tesla.
TSLA down ~$500M Friday, but back up ~$500M today. Sorry for the roller coaster.
Somebody needs to tell Kim Jong-un that the showbiz phrase "break a leg" doesn't mean what he thinks it does
A Tesla Roadster just passed the 100,000 mile mark for the first time and still has over 200 miles of range.
Model S Performance powertrain produced so much torque today that we broke the dyno. 4.4 sec 0-60 mph will not be a problem.
Next month is also when our Dragon spaceship docks with the Space Station for the first time. Major pucker factor...
Feb is huge month. Model X world premier and public reveal of our LA design studio on the 9th. Stay tuned for more details.
Just finished Massie's book on Catherine. An amazingly expansive and compelling portrait of an incredible woman. Highly recommend.
@om Respectfully disagree. Larrymade awesome moves last year, which laid the foundation for G+ to kick butt in 2012. He's a stud.
What everyone really thinks ... @jonlovett: If Mayans were good at predicting the future, there'd be Mayans.
I said *information* weapons for a reason. The bit is mightier than the bomb.
We built powerful information weapons to fight enemies of liberty. Now those enemies are largely defeated, but the weapons remain.
@FareedZakaria However, China's real estate crisis will explode in a way that makes ours look puny. They can't hide it for much longer.
@FareedZakaria Yeah, 2012 will be great for the American economy & jobs, as we've mostly dealt with the overbuilt housing crisis.
My first prediction of 2012 has come true: ouch, my head hurts.
World violence being super low is probably counter-intuitive to most people. That's because modern media is a misery microscope.
Hacked my Tesla charge connector on a small island in the rain last night #whatcouldpossiblygowrong
Not that this really matters. All current rocket tech, including ours, sucks. Only when it becomes fully reusable, will it not suck.
SpaceX has Boeing, Lockheed, Europe (Ariane) and Russia (Proton/Soyuz) near checkmate in rocket technology. End game is all about China.
To be clear, CtG absolutely did *not* bang her horse. They were just close friends who liked to take showers together and spoon at night.
Right mood, scented candles, Barry White singing "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Baby" and the magic (by that I mean horsef*ing) happens ...
I'm just saying that u shouldn't pass judgment based on one night of passion. Sometimes things just happen and u go with the moment :)
Sew one button, doesn't make u a tailor; cook one meal, doesn't make u a chef; but f* one horse and u r a horsef*er for all of history...
Am reading Robert Massie's book on Catherine the Great. Yeah, I know what you're probably thinking ... did she really f* a horse?
Interesting Economist article about how humanity's collective actions have created a fundamentally new geological age -- the Anthropocene.
@om Cool personal essay. It really resonated with me, as I felt the same way after coming very close to dying from malaria ten years ago.
@richardbranson Liked "Screw Business as Usual" a lot. This approach should be taken to heart by all, as it really is the smart move.
@kanyewest Just returned from Haiti. For those who want to help, I recommend donating to MSF, UNICEF and Artists for Peace & Justice.
Met with UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and Artists for Peace & Justice. I support them and would recommend others do too.
Just returned from a trip to Haiti. Covered a lot of ground and saw many tough situations. They need a lot of help.
Single character Tweets are the ulitmate extension of the Twitmeme...
We had a long and interesting conversation on many subjects. He has exciting ideas for extending his creative talents beyond music.
Yeah, this really is me, as my Mom @mayemusk will attest.nNot sure I can handle just doing 140 char missives. Will put longer thoughts on G+
Got called randomly by Kanye West today and received a download of his thoughts, ranging from shoes to Moses. He was polite, but opaque.
Read "Lying", the new book by my friend Sam Harris.Excellent cover art and lots of good reasons not to lie!
Am reading a great biography of Ben Franklin by Isaacson. Highly recommended.
Great Voltaire quote, arguably better than Twain. Hearing news of his own death, Voltaire replied the reports were true, only premature.

So honored to have known you David, you are a bonafide hero to an entire generation of hip-hop kids and musical dreamers. Miss you Axe!!!
David could be incredibly intimidating, and; he did not suffer fools...but if he liked and; respected you, he was the most loyal friend on earth.
I'll never forget meeting him for the first time in 1998. We asked him to do a remix for "Rabbit In Your Headlights" off the Unkle album.
Producer and composer extraordinaire David Axelrod has passed. Listening to "Songs Of Experience" on repeat for the remainder of the day.

Hate is the power source of most of the evil in this world. I refuse to contribute to it
Many thanks to @observer @EW @PigsAndPlans @LAMusicBlog (among others) for including "Nobody Speak" and TMWF LP on your year-end lists
That's a good place to end this...thanks for reading
(Minimum 10 years active), which is why there's no "new artists" on the list
Final round of what I suppose could be considered "a partial list of the most impactful artists and individuals in my musical life to date"
Today and every day, I give thanks to the following prophets, scholars, and inspired individuals who have filled my life with musical light:
Tragic. I stand in solidarity with the marginalized, the poor, the defenseless, the maligned, the non-white. May God forgive us all
Very sad to hear of the passing of French synthesizer pioneer (and good friend) Jean-Jacques Perrey. Rest In Peace JJ, your music lives on 
Oh wow, Dublin that was fu--ing SICK, I've been away far too long!! Thank you @metro_festival for the opportunity

Just played @mbeKCRW live for my longtime friend @jason_bentley . Thanks for the opportunity @kcrw !!
A pro tip for anyone planning to attend tonight's show in LA: there will be 15 copies of a tour exclusive 12" on a 1st-come 1st-served basis
You'll hear some rare/unheard audio of me scratching and mixing from 1988 to the present. Check it out, you might enjoy it 
The 1st show was about the music that informed the production on TMWF, this one focuses on the evolution of my DJ style through the years.
Last week I recorded a new episode of my occasional series #Radioface for @Beats1 , it premiers Thursday at 7pm pacific, 10pm eastern.
After a few weeks busying myself with other tasks, I'm relieved to announce that the US tour kicks off tonight in San Diego. @DJ_POUND ,too!
Shouts to @AdrianYounge @AliShaheed @HouseShoes @madlib @djnobody and all the other friends and peers who stopped by today
Finished resetting the store with fresh stock and looking forward to tomorrow
Today was enthralling. Everybody was completely in sync w the spirit of the event, despite my fears to the contrary. It was touching to see
@TheAshleyBeedle @AndyHermannLA Don't worry there will be plenty of cheapies on hand!
@BenCazzola ha. Not "selling my collection..." just lazy clickbait headlinesout there misleading folks
@insomniacdotcom nope. Not selling my collection...just some duplicates...I know it's confusing
@oliverswang True, but in this case I'm only selling records I already have a file copy of.
@oliverswang I think that's because non-collectors automatically assume that all collectors are hoarders.
People keep texting me like "Yo, tell me it's not true!!" Everything is fine, ha ha. Just a little pop-up sale for fun. Stop in!
Regarding the pop-up store in LA this weekend: I am not "selling my record collection." Just some duplicates I have picked up thru the years
@MistahFAB what's good Fabby, dm me and let's link
@dancingastro not really...just some duplicates and other stuff I had sitting around in quantity
Excited for tonight's show in Mexico City!! Been way too long...
Less than one hour 'til stage here @o2abc in Glasgow! Fond memories of the last visit during the Shadowsphere tour in '11

@CodyAllen191 @MassAppealRecs don't worry, it'll happen
I hope this 2-hour mix is fully representative of my DJ aesthetic: demonstrating a love for our musical past and present in equal measure.
The second hour: a left turn (naturally). Music very dear to my heart that is heretofore unknown. Definitely one for the hip-hop fanatics.
The 1st hour is an homage to the genius I hear around me on a daily basis. New beats, new ideas. Lots of Cali stuff bc that's where I dwell.
Back to the new mix. Fun fact #2: I recorded the first half in April, right after finishing the new album. Had to get it in before tour prep
In fact a NY Times journalist recently asked if she could do a story about the phenomenon. Hopefully that'll happen soon. I'm ready 2 reveal
The slow, moody singer/songwriter track near the end of the mix is one of the most asked-about records I've ever shared in any context.
I put so much energy into it that I decided to issue it as a limited 2xCD package called "Diminishing Returns." Stickers and; coasters included
Ok, just a few more hours until my new @essentialmix drops on @BBCR1 . Fun fact #1: my first Essential Mix debuted over 13 years ago.
My @essentialmix airs this weekend.First hour, killer new beats. Hour 2 is strictly for the collectors.  @BBCR1
@blackalicious_ X, Gab, let's build!!! 
@gillespeterson @nilsfrahm @matthalsalljazz much love always G!
The realization that my first solo show in over four years.....is tomorrow 
@zanelowe: Ooooohhhh this new @djshadow record is a HEATER #WorldRecord coming in 40 minutes @Beats1 #ShoutYourTown
@AnthonyMackONE I will definitely be playing somewhere near you next year.
Friends in the biz who genuinely want you to win are rare. That's why I appreciate my dude @TruthspeakerHQ always
Although I am a "group of one," I owe a debt of gratitude to the many friends and peers who help me out in countless ways on a daily basis
I need a car with a horn in the back to warn the driver behind me to look up from their phone because I'm slowing down.
@musecymru @MotionBristol I'm not sure yet, I will try to find out...but if all else fails contact the venue, that's what I would do
So much love for my dudes @therealelp @KillerMike and @djtrackstar , thanks for everything fellas #RTJMF
Prince, Michael, and James Brown ALL JAMMING RIGHT NOW
Genuinely shocked, saddened by the loss of talent unparalleled. Let his musical gifts heal us all today and forever. Thank you Prince
Turn your dial to @Beats1 at 12PM EST tomorrow for something new #TheMountainWillFall
. @noertheboy , illest beat maker out right now IMO.Evolving too fast to keep up with 
Nobody ever made interesting music worrying about their "legacy"
Whoever makes it through the social media era with their dignity, self-respect, and faith in humanity intact...wins.
Celebrating the life and rhymes of Phife Dawg today...reign in peace king, and thank you for the wisdom #ATCQ4EVER
Curry's brilliance transcends sports. Beyond inspirational
Day 205 of working on the new album. Summit almost within view.
@RapAndSoulPromo: @EveningStandard chose @Cut_Chemist and @djshadow's 'Renegades of Rhythm' as their 'Gig of the Year'. @O2ForumKTown ht
Gatekeepers in the industry been telling me for 25 years that I don't belong. I KNOW I don't belong. That's why I'm still here.
If you're an artist who has any empathy for the human experience, you're finding it hard to concentrate these days.
@RUCKAZOID Bruh 
When it comes to music, I'm really just a glorified editor...I reduce broad palettes of sound down to a focused narrative of notes and; beats
"Superpeople" by The Notations, one of my favorite songs of all time. A soulful rebuke of violence and hate, never more relevant than now
Day 124. That sweet spot when all you want to do from the moment you wake is stay zoned in the lab.
@zanelowe: #Beats1.n@gjonesbass @bleepbloopbass 'Mind' (@Lunice Remix) #WorldRecordn@djshadow talks new musicn@alt_J hang outnExclusive 
Out here in London taking care of some long overdue business. Positive moves to produce positive results
Very saddened to hear about the passing of a true pioneer, the one and only Skatemaster Tate. Rest in peace my dude.
.@Lunice and @eprombeats playing tonight in the city. So you know where imma be...
To my peers leading glamorous lives, I salute you. To those quietly and humbly handling your business, I salute you more.
I feel it's important to teach children that not so long ago, musicians were almost universally respected and admired for their craft
Low End Theory Festival yesterday was beautiful. Gotta support when the good guys are winning
Now THAT was a dope set. With @daddykev the night has officially begun
Arrived at Low End Theory Festival. Shout-out to dude on stage wearing a Shadow t-shirt
I care about beats, hip-hop culture, records, music history, and being a DJ, that's about it. Not really concerned with all that other stuff
@mixmastermike @DJRizNyc @jperiodBK @KLEVERSWORLD @Dj4our5ive @vekked Damn, dawg!! 
Ooo @bleepbloopbass killin dem right now in the Town
At Feels 3 in Oakland checkin out @DeejayEarl_ that first track tho!!! Beautiful night
So proud to welcome my dude @Mophono to the @LiquidAmber100 family, one of the Bay Area's best kept secrets will be secret no longer
@theKONE when I had more time just to sit and woodshed, the songs would stack up. In this case, it was necessary 2 set a specific start date
Day 3 working on the new album...the Confidence Crisis Express pulled in right on schedule.Decided not to hop on.
@bleepbloopbass thanks in advance for answering all of my Ableton questions, ha ha
One step follows the next which leads the way to the next. There will be missteps but as long as the vision is whole, the mountain will fall
It's like being at base camp and looking up at an unconquerable mountain; can't dwell on the difficulty, you have to just start the journey
Good vibes rite now @LOWENDTHEORY enjoying this @MonoXPoly set
Hey Chicago, I'm gonna be playing 45s with some friends tonight at Sheer Magic. 1951 W. Dickens. Fall through!
@DJ_POUND @gjonesbass sorry he wrote your name wrong..."Pounds," ha ha
@questlove @DJHarrisonRVA WHAAAAAT that's a great look
Thank you @STOKYO for the box of swag, much appreciated
@loxlemurray Next year maybe...trying to stay off the road the rest of this year. Working, learning, and taking stock.
@KingOfDaBurbz I'll see what I can dig out. I know I have an X-Clan poster from when they played at the Rec Hall in '91
@KingOfDaBurbz ha ha, you mean of shows I played, or shows I attended? Got a couple
Happy Birthday to legendary producer and arranger David Axelrod...maverick, genius and personal hero of mine
@LiquidAmber100: .@bleepbloopbass 's 10WL is avail on 7" vinyl today for 24 hrs starting at 4PM EST for $12 thru @Bandcamp. Purchase: ht
Sometimes, forces within the universe conspire to send a singular message: it's time to take a break. A LONG break.
@sherine_saade not for awhile...nothing scheduled
Let's create something, recluse-style "@jetfury :Hello Mr Shadow.It's taken 20 years to say hello!
What a ride, what an honor. THANK YOU Afrika Bambaataa, UZN, Cornell Hip-Hop Archive, @Cut_Chemist and; every1 who attended #RenegadesofRhythm
@leggydd possibly but too soon to know. Keeping the door open
Sydney was ALL IN for the #RenegadesofRhythm show last night. Brisbane tonight, Perth Saturday for the final two performances this year
And then there were four...the final #RenegadesofRhythm shows kick off tonight in Melbourne @espyhotel
@NapalmDef something different...already contemplating
Only four shows remaining...bittersweet. Going to have to savor every moment
I generally prefer to play and support new music, but the Renegades set is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to revisit and embrace my roots
So fun playing outdoors tonight in Adelaide, Cut nailed it when he said, "Felt like a park jam." Full-throttle hip-hop for a crowd of 3,500+
Arrived in Canberra. Honored to manifest the teachings of Bambaataa in Australia: "Peace, Unity, Love, and Having Fun" #RenegadesofRhythm
.@Ruckazoid, @LiquidAmber100 and I are giving away free 'Money.' Text 510-860-4436 to receive (Ltd quantity, may take 10mins) #scratchgod

@THEREALBANNER people weren't expecting us to come positive in '06 but time will reveal all
Connecting a sense of place to the music I enjoy from all over the world is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a touring DJ.
I remember leaving Bulgaria, homesick and; tired from touring, and; "I Got 5 On It" was playing over the airplane speaker. I was like TAKE ME HOME
Music from the San Francisco Bay Area speaks to me in a special way...it's in my soul, a reflection of the landscape in which I was born
We all have a special affinity to music from the region and community in which we were raised. For many, it is a profound and lifelong bond.
@solesides @mowaxplease that's actually from a photo shoot in London with @blackalicious_ in April '94
The next week looks like this: Zagreb tonight, Prague tomorrow. Then Helsinki, Tallinn, and Vilnius. #RenegadesOfRhythm testifying worldwide
@DJBollard @Cut_Chemist yeah we may do *something* like that
@MarkGoodliff @Cut_Chemist yo did u try to hook something up in the UK?
@TomSavage75 you're very welcome, thanks for attending
Excellent finish to a stellar UK swing tonight in Bristol. Many thanks to all who came out, Manchester/London/Bristol #RenegadesOfRhythm
@djfood: Tonight @djshadow and; @Cut_Chemist smashed it in London, their best collab so far and a fitting homage to Bam and Hip Hop history
London, tonight's show @TheForumHQ is SOLD OUT but if u check twitter there's a few people selling...we go on at 9pm tonight so don't delay.
Can't say I'm surprised...Manchester, best audience of the tour so far. THANK YOU

#ManchesterShows with 'Mo Wax crew @ Sankey's Soap in '94...with Radiohead @ Nynex Arena in '97...with Richard Ashcroft @ Old Trafford in '02...
This marks my 21st year of playing shows in Manchester, England. Deeply appreciative of the support over the decades. So many memories...
@Marshcp @Alberthallmcr @Cut_Chemist we go on at 9pm.
I figure I got about 20 good years left. Imma give my all until I fall
@mhood77 no sadly...we only had a few left after the N America run
@mhood77 eh, a few shirts and posters...usual ting
Cheers Reims!! Some serious music lovers in the crowd tonight. Off to Geneva now, then Manchester, London, and Bristol #renegadesofrhythm

@Pleasure_Beats @LiquidAmber100 yes, email michael@djshadow.com
@Phenomejon5 yes, we recorded/filmed the Oakland show
@yayitsjp It's a 45. Have never seen another copy and the original artist doesn't have any either
@stme_music @Cut_Chemist For sure. I asked specifically why we weren't going to Scotland or Ireland on several occasions. Will keep trying
@patrickdevereux thanks for that, much appreciated
@ZackSwendrowski @Cut_Chemist would love to! thank you
@HomelandRadio please reach out to jamal@djshadow.com and he'll hook it up
@stme_music @Cut_Chemist Of course we'd love to come but apparently the booking offers weren't up to par this time for some reason
@blues_x_man just decided some time ago that there's only so many times I want to be photographed with my records. Feels tired after a while
@WakeTheFlokUp sure, hit up jamal@djshadow.com and we'll get it in
@BoatLouise would love to but someone there has to book us
Got that @drugusebeats @djnobody test press in the mail today...bless!!!

@djmadphlexx: In order to preserve the essence of DJing (#1 element of hip-hop) we have to have "VINYL ONLY" events like @Cut_Chemist and; 
@Cut_Chemist and; I are paying tribute to the genius of Bambaataa in our final 3 shows of the year: Edmonton 2nite, Calgary 2moro, Oakland Tues
I decided to pursue a communications degree because of a Yo!MTVRaps interview with Kool Moe Dee in 1989. I needed direction, rap provided it
Rappers like @MrChuckD , @IAmKRSOne , Rakim, and; even @FINALLEVEL taught me to view the world differently, with humility and maturity
I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where there was a true variety of personalities and viewpoints within hip-hop
Yup, just arrive to the venue for soundcheck around 5:30, we got you RT"@atheg74: @djshadow are signatures a part of the VIP package?"

@StrangeMusicInc: Can't lie it was pretty dope hearing @djshadow in that Chevy commercial
@sabirius: @djshadow 's version of "Meiso" might be my favorite break track ever, if not, at least in the top 5. #synergy #goodmusic

@DanteRoss That means a lot, thank you! Sadly, I leave Austin tomorrow...gig is tonight and then right back to Cali
Been coming to Austin for 19 years. It's changed a lot, but I loved it then and I love it now
Busy week. #SXSW tonight, @beatteamsupreme event on Friday, and a surprise on Wednesday...
Before eBay, record collectors stayed in their own lanes. Rock dealers wouldn't touch soul, etc. Now everyone's an 'expert' in everything. $
I can't come to Austin without thinking about how fun it used to be to tear this town apart buying funk 45s when literally no one else was
Honored to be playing with @Machine_Drum and @reggiewatts tonight for this @VICE event! #SXSW #Austin
@PNM_79 Ha naw, didn't even know they were gonna do that...pretty damn funny though
Ames Harris Desert Water Bag Company playing in this restaurant. Mind blown. Most obscure music I've ever heard in a public setting.
Watch out for that new @grrrreatdane!!!! Heavy artillery
CRUSHED IT. Most fun I've had at a show in a minute. Thanks to everyone who helped make tonight great. #BayAreaLove
Damn, @710BLEEPBLOOP KILLIN it right now #AcidInTheFreezer
Just standing here in the entrance handing out free t-shirts to commemorate tonight's show...first 50 in tha door all cop a shirt
Big show tonight. Want to do well for the home team
It's humbling to know that anything I could think of doing as a beat maker, Kurtis Mantronik already did.
Perth!! Thanks for your positivity, I really appreciate it! Had a lot of fun playing for you tonight
Biggest audience I've ever played to in New Zealand, and by far the most hype...yep!!! This tour has been really good. Perth Australia 2moro
Hip-hop was, is, and always will be the soundtrack of my life
Melbourne, I truly appreciate what an incredible crowd I played to tonight. You're an inspiration. Thank you
10pm set time for tonight's (sold out) Melbourne show
Tasmania!! Now I know why the Quannum guys used to rave about this place...thanks for the amazing time!
Let someone else keep the shine. I just wanna do good work
Making beats on my day off. I'm boring but I'm cool with that
So @Cut_Chemist just reminded me that I had asked Jazzy Jay to remix "The Number Song" as well...had totally forgotten about that, wow
Thanks to all who came out in Sydney tonight, tremendous fun
Bob James' "Nautilus" (one of my all-time favorite songs) is playing in the lobby of this hotel
Good time last night in Brisbane. Got to play my new stuff, which seemed to get a good reaction, so that's nice. Off to Sydney now!
Good to see my dude @sampology after the Brisbane show, and how bout @djembadjembaa playing right next door?!? #SmallWorld
Honored to be kicking off my 19th year of touring in Australia tonight in Brisbane.
So, I'm playing @indysf as part of their #indy10year series on February 22nd. The show sold out in 2 hours.Can I just say, I'm stoked.
This set is shaping up to be the purest, most potent distillation yet of what I value in music right at this very moment. No prisoners
Several of my folks did some sick remixes of Shadow tunes, which I plan on debuting during next week's Australia/New Zealand run
@DearLola1 I live in the SF area but I'm in LA all the time
Oh yes...less than two weeks until I touch down in Australia and New Zealand. #Brisbane #Sydney #Melbourne #Hobart #Auckland #Perth #Stoked
@710BLEEPBLOOP killin it at the SF @djembadjembaa @kinghenryla show right now
@bensprows Ha ha! Mos def, nothing but love for Trenton! Love that Poor Righteous Teachers video
@Machine_Drum: working on this @djshadow remix. sounding on point. get ready, here we go
I feel bad hassling dudes but I'm a DJ and I play music so...
If it wasn't for the contributions of my famous and soon-to-be-famous friends, my DJ sets would be way less dope #MuchoAppreciado
Speaking of Australia, did you know that @tameimpala once did a remix for me? It was for a song I couldn't release cause of samples #gutted
I dedicate this weekend to my upcoming Australia DJ tour. Just putting in work, making a short list of tracks I wanna play. Catching vibes
I've never played Tasmania before. A while back someone told me that the @beastieboys, @FINALLEVEL and I think @PublicEnemyFTP played there
I am heading to Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania this February. It's been waaaay too long!
If you're a sports fan, it's pretty hard to eff with the SF Bay Area.
Gang Starr's "Take It Personal..." Pretty much the dopest beat ever
Spent part of the night listening to rejects from my last album, which I started 4 years ago this month. Harrowing. I was not a well person
@thisisjohnbook: "But if you stay in the game long enough, you've got to lose... and once you've lost there's no way back, no way at all
@DanteRoss Thank you! The drums were actually inspired as much by punk as anything else...I was trying to program to capture that energy
How many United miles do I need to qualify for basic human acknowledgement? #TravelSector #BottomOfTheBarrel
Thanks to @KDVS903fm for providing welcome distraction during a hellacious dental procedure today. College radio lives!!!

Final round of #AllBassesCovered2013 shows kicks off tomorrow night in St. Louis! The homie @salva will be playing as well, it's a wrap
I think we made 20 copies. Whatever the minimum order was. X got 10 or so, I got a handful, and the rest went who knows where.
Now it can be told: I helped arrange and mix the #GTAV soundtrack score for @RockstarGames
1 hour from stage in Toronto on a Friday night! #AllBassesCovered2013
Seattle is always always ALWAYS a good time #AllBassesCovered2013

Oh man am I coming with some NEW for the next round of shows...best job in the world #AllBassesCovered2013
Excellent vibes at @KaleidoscopeMF Oregon, thanks to everyone here
Was chopping it up with @amplive that's a good dude right there
He talked about coughing over the curse words in songs so that his parents couldn't hear them...made me laugh out loud, a page from my past
I always thought it strange that I've neverformally met @questlove before, but having just read his book, I now feel like I have
Lotsa fun in MA this weekend, I'm super appreciative of the support as always!! #AllBassesCovered2013
Tomorrow night's show in Cambridge/Boston is SOLD OUT, thank you!!!
It's windy and raining, which always makes a great excuse to play "Stormy Weather" by @grrrreatdane
I'm playing Martha's Vineyard 2night. I wonder if the President is going 2 show up, I heard he's a fan of aggressive contemporary bass music
@donaldkrunkaus: S/O to @djshadow for playing our track  off the realness on his Radio one mix 
Like the time in France when Mot started playing on the second stage during a particularly mellow Radiohead performance #comedic
One of my favorite things about festivals is the way music from the different stages collide to create unintentionally brilliant mash-ups
I finally get to see Death Grips play...they're on right before me #FUJIROCK #HardActToFollow

Dear Hollywood, I think we're pretty much good on the Pulp Fiction, two-fingers-across-the-eyes dance, thanks anyway
Every time I come to Tokyo, I think about my first visit almost 20 years ago...Futura 2000 was my guide and the record stores were BONKERS
I aspire for greatness but usually fall well short. Such is the journey...
Playing tonight in Luxembourg, tomorrow in Gijon (Spain), and Sunday in Belgium @dourfestival...then off to Japan for @fujirock_jp #blessed
Gracias @soundwavecro!!! Leaving in 5 hours to Luxembourg...it don't stop #AllBassesCovered2013
Arrived @soundwavecro on the Dalmatian Coast...I think it's gonna be jammin tonight!! #AllBassesCovered2013
Thinking about the homie @GASLAMPKILLER today...hang in there my dude
Arrived in Croatia, another first for me...looking forward to tomorrow night! #AllBassesCovered2013
Hello, Budapest! Heading to sound check soon ahead of tonight's show...it's an early one, so don't miss out #AllBassesCovered2013
Looking forward to a day off in Amsterdam. Life is good
Was great to see all the Utrecht homies...especially my man @Krampfhaft
That was a blast @fabriclondon, thanks for sharing some music with me!! #AllBassesCovered2013
My first (only??) UK set this year, going down tonight @fabriclondon...with @Machine_Drum, @hoya_hoya, @BullionNess, @Planetmurecords...zzap
Just got back from BBC headquarters, recording a few things...for what purpose, you ask? Stay tuned...(Lets just say I've been busy lately)
Heading to London. Been WAAAY too long. #Gratitude
@Machine_Drum: Holy shit! @ZaneLowe will be premiering a remix of Eyesdontlie by the one, the only @DJShadow tonight 8pm on @BBCR1 ! Tun
I'm gonna be working on this Fabric set right up until the last possible minute, I can feel it
There's some really good beats coming out of Australia right now
Shout-out to @djnobody, one of the nicest people I've ever met, for real
My Fridays are dedicated exclusively to checking out as much new music as humanly possible.
@thisisjohnbook: BTW: I still feel when Anti-Pop Consortium (@antipopny) opened for @DJShadow on his 2002 tour, that was some great hip-
Working on a remix for a friend. I'll debut it next month at Fabric.
I lost most of my 'rock' fans after The Outsider, which is too bad, because I think some of them would have liked TLYKTB
Whether I find anything or not is almost irrelevant; it's a lifestyle and a state of mind. Plus, I've been doing it my whole life.
I consider myself well-balanced musically. For example, I still go digging on off days.
The homies @TwoFreshbeats killing it at Red Rocks
And now, my attention turns to Red Rocks. #AllBassesCovered2013
Lincoln, Nebraska!I will definitely be coming back here, my new favorite place to play.Thanks for the GREAT time
Express Rising II.You need it in your life, trust me.
Nebraska, I go on at almost midnight tonight, so don't worry about any time conflict w other shows in the area #AllBassesCovered2013
Getting ready 2 head to Lincoln, Nebraska. Another first made possible by the fact that I'm rolling light (no visuals or lights, just music)
People keep telling me every day that I look tired. At some point those people need to realize that this is my face
Just spent six hours on a forty second transition in my set. Not sure whether to laugh or cry
I don't care about charts, sales/views, or blogger hype. If it's good music, it's in, period. The artists I play know what I'm talking about
My formula for determining what music to DJ is the same as it was 25 years ago...I seek out the dopest beats, and I play them. End of story.
Got my eyes on the Warriors game and; my ears in this new music I'm adding 4 this weekend's shows...nothing better than holding exclusive fire
Wow, this @Thundercatbass track sounds like a HIT to me... #goodnewmusic
Shout-out to the homie @clicksxwhistles for sliding me some of his new beats!!! Bass for days
Showtime at 11 tonight El Paso #AllBassesCovered2013
Tulsa, I respect you...thanks for a great time #AllBassesCovered2013
En route to Tulsa for my FIRST-EVER show in the state of Oklahoma...El Paso TX tomorrow #AllBassesCovered2013
Amazing venue, amazing crowd. I've said it a million times and I'll say it again...I love Austin. #AllBassesCovered2013
Tonight's SOLD OUT show in Austin moved bc of thunderstorm concerns...now at ACL Live at Moody Theater. BIGGER venue, so more tix released!
Fact: Madison, WI is a great city to play. And, fans that drive hours between shows just to support are the best fans there are. Thank you
Madison encore show tonight, completely new set from last time FYI...that's why it's called: #AllBassesCovered2013
Ok MKE!!! I go on at 11 tonight. Honored to be back in Brewtown. @miltownbeatdown #AllBassesCovered2013
Getting ready to drive to Milwaukee for tonight's show...and Madison, WI tomorrow #AllBassesCovered2013
Twin Cities, I'm excited to be here. I go on at 10:30pm tonight. You will not believe the ((B-A-S-S)) in this place
Touched down in Minneapolis ahead of tomorrow's show.What happened to Spring??? Time to bring the heat #AllBassesCovered2013
Santa Ana, California. TONIGHT. @The Observatory. TONIGHT. Midnight. TONIGHT. #AllBassesCovered2013
Cali bound. Finally have a few days to settle in and make some beats #LongOverdue
Sad to be leaving Maine, would have loved to have had some time off here...next time! Thanks for a great first show, Portland
Wow, so much fun tonight in Pittsburgh...audience was up for anything. So nice to play to an open-minded crowd! Portland, Maine tomorrow
Back in The 'Burgh for tonight's show, it's been too long since I played here...11 years, to be exact #AllBassesCovered2013
Thought I'd be playing the same songs as last time? Nope. Most tunes r brand new and/or unreleased and; exclusive...in addition 2 my own stuff
Late set tonight at Output Brooklyn w @FaltyDL ! Doors are at 10pm, I go on at 1:30am...honored to be back, NYC #AllBassesCovered2013
Glad to have my feet back on solid Brooklyn ground for Thursday night's show #AllBassesCovered2013
Just landed at JFK, apparently plane was hit by lightning...not cool.
@GASLAMPKILLER You're a tough act to follow my brother! It was an honor
Thank you to the entire @LOWENDTHEORY fam and to everyone in San Francisco who came out to hear something a lil different! #Respect
@djdstyles is killin it!!! @LOWENDTHEORY #AllBassesCovered2013
Packing up my gear, getting ready to head to soundcheck @LOWENDTHEORY SF...it's going down tonight!! #AllBassesCovered2013
Gearing up for @LOWENDTHEORY SF tomorrow night, can't wait!! #AllBassesCovered2013
My man @salva laced me with some straight heat, one of the dopest out there right now
Man, Charlottesville got DOWN tonight...dope crowd, perfect venue, great time all around. Would play here again in a heartbeat #Respect
Athens, GA. Soooo glad I finally stopped through! That was really fun for me, thanks to your enthusiasm and goodwill.See you again!!
In a hotel room in Athens, GA making tweaks to the set ahead of tonight's show at Georgia Theatre.As always, expect the unexpected
Working hard on the set getting ready for next week's shows: Athens GA, Charlottesville VA, and Nashville TN, all first timers for me
Poland, thank you for your faith and generosity.Had a tremendous time.#AllBassesCovered2013
Playing in an old public swimming pool tonight in Warsaw.Sound system is LOUD...recipe for a good night #AllBassesCovered2013
It CrANkED tonight in Poznan, Poland... #AllBassesCovered2013
I bump this @DroopE707 "N The Traffic" track, @NiteJewel sounds great in it
My first coast-to-coast US tour was with @Jeruthedamaja, April 1997.#PersonalFirsts
The first record I ever played in Europe was Kings Of Pressure "You Know How To Reach Us (Instrumental)."Berlin, 1993.#PersonalFirsts
Excited for tonight, the first of 3 gigs in Poland! Gdansk was NUTS last time, so I have high expectations... #AllBassesCovered2013
Very special to get to meet everyone after the gig, THANK YOU St. Petersburg, let's do it again SOON!!
Looking forward to tonight's show in St. Petersburg at Kosmonavt Club!! I go on at 9pm
The last time I was in Russia it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit...this time it's only 15.St. Petersburg is amazing any time of year
Frankfurt represented! Not bad for a rainy Sunday night #AllBassesCovered2013
Athens that was AWESOME, it's so much more enjoyable when the audience has an open mind...thank you, and hope to be back soon!! #gratitude
In the middle of 4 gigs in a row, Athens, Greece tonight!! #AllBassesCovered2013
Being able to travel the world doing what you love for a living is both a gift and a responsibility, neither of which I take lightly.
Thank you Antwerp, for coming out to an early Monday night show, much appreciated. #Respect
Paris and Eindhoven were DOPE, Antwerp tonight! #AllBassesCovered2013
UNREAL line-up tonight in Eindhoven: @Machine_Drum, @eprombeats, @Lunice, @HudMo (and myself)... #swagnostic
New year, new set: All Basses Covered 2013.Europe, get ready!!
This week I'm reading 'And Party Every Day: The Casablanca Records Story' by Larry Harris
Big respect to @beatteamsupreme, destroying Low End SF with some insane beats on a Friday night #swagnostic
Have spent the first three weeks of 2013 immersed in music. For this simple yet utterly essential pleasure, I am grateful.
Great night tonight in the Bay, thank you Wintersalt Fest and the homies Latyrx for an amazing end to the year
Or maybe it was all the trap and; juke that preceded it...I dunno. I'll get the set up on soundcloud soon so every1 can enjoy. Happy Holidays!
Ironically it was drum and bass that broke the camel's back(!) Note to self...play more drum and bass!!!
I appreciate everyone's support. Obviously I should have never been booked there in the first place. Square peg in a round hole, etc #iDoMe
I don't care if I get kicked out of every rich kid club on the planet. I will never sacrifice my integrity as a DJ...ever #AllBassesCovered
Atlanta, I'm looking forward to playing for you tonight.
That said, tonight's set in Miami WILL proceed as planned...I go on at 3am (yes, 3am!) Atlanta tomorrow #AllBassesCovered
The challenge for any "entertainer" working on this tragic day is to find a place to compartmentalize the sorrow in order to carry on...
Thank u 2 @bassiklife 4 bringing me out 2 Nola, helluva show! Loved meeting everyone at the signing table. C u next year! #AllBassesCovered
Just wrapped up sound check at The Republic. First time I've done this type of set in Nola, EVER. The homie @Salva is playing 2nite as well
Touched down in New Orleans, my musical home-away-from-home. Playing @Republic TOMORROW, Miami Friday, Atlanta Saturday. #AllBassesCovered
Brooklyn Bowl tonight! This show sold out weeks ago, so I know it's going to be ON #AllBassesCovered
Once again I'm so honored 2 meet everyone after the show tonight in Boston, thank you 4 having fun w me and forgetting that it's a Sunday!
I love that people r "getting" what this set is all about...if ur not moving forward, ur standing still. As an artist, the choice is simple.
Here we go, Boston! I go on at 10pm tonight 'cause it's Sunday, just FYI #AllBassesCovered
DETROIT!! That's three sold out nights in a row, thank you!! Tonight was amazing...Boston up next! #AllBassesCovered
Last night was sold out, as was the night before...Detroit, do I hear three-in-a-row?? #AllBassesCovered
Thank you, Chicago! DETROIT TONIGHT, Boston tomorrow #AllBassesCovered
Getting ready to try to crush Chicago (one of my all-time favorite cities) tonight at The Mid! I go on at 12:30am, FYI #AllBassesCovered
Wow Madison WI, thank you so much for all of the love during and after the set, that was truly humbling. I had a blast, hope it showed.
Tonight's show is sold out. Dope!! #AllBassesCovered
About to go on in Madison.Need to keep my wits about me...most of tonight's set is basically unrehearsed! #AllBassesCovered
Case in point: Madison, WI tonight. Looking forward to it! #AllBassesCovered
The nice thing about doing DJ sets, as opposed to the full live show, is that I'm able to visit smaller markets I've never been to before
Putting in WORK getting ready for these USA shows...first up is Madison, Wisconsin this Thursday #AllBassesCovered #BackInTheSaddle
Sharing the stage tonight in Manchester with @flyinglotus, JamieXX and Squarepusher...quite a line-up #warehouseproject #AllBassesCovered
Next stop: Manchester, England...the Warehouse Project. Final UK gig of 2012. Looking forward to this one
Star Slinger played b4 me 2nite in Istanbul and; I just now realized that's the same dude who did the Gold Panda remix I've been playing...duh!
Back on the road! Tonight: Prague! Tomorrow: Istanbul! It don't stop. #AllBassesCovered
Arrived at tonight's secret gig! Low End Theory L.A.!! Come on down...2419 N Broadway

Late show tonight in Barcelona...like around a 3am start. Tomorrow is Madrid, and Monday, Marseille. Then....? (watch this space)
Thank you to anyone and everyone who has ever paid to support my art. I respect your trust in my craft and that's how I continue to grow
You can pay for YouTube views and twitter followers, but real fans can't be bought; they are earned.
Touched down in Santiago, Chile. I go on at 1am, in case you're making plans
Sao Paolo, my new favorite city. How has it taken this long?? I've been missing out...thanks for an amazing night, I can't wait to return
This week I'm reading Kraftwerk Publikation, a biography by David Buckley. Great backstory about Computer World, one of my all-time fav LPs
Bogota, thank you for being a wonderful host on my first trip to Columbia. I really appreciate the support.
Seems to me that South America is one of the few places left that still has a genuine intellectual curiosity about music
Always have been, and always will be, a hip-hop DJ. But I will play something different if the mood strikes me or the situation demands it
Gotta say, this @CoronaFest schedule is one of the best line-ups I've ever seen...from Shabazz Palaces to New Order. And that's just today
Upon arrival in Mexico, the customs form asked if I was bringing any "samples." For me, that's kind of a trick question
Getting ready to fly to Mexico City to begin a solid run of SA dates. Columbia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina. Life is good. #AllBassesCovered
Toronto soundcheck is complete.Final Canadian date of the year tonight. #AllBassesCovered
Thanks again to the promoters who brought me out to Burlington, felt good to bring a little bit of California to Vermont...much appreciated
Burlington, Vermont tonight.Montreal tomorrow, then Toronto on Saturday. #AllBassesCovered
Ashland, Oregon tonight! First-ever show in this part of the state...I go on at 10-ish #AllBassesCovered
Seattle, that was special...what an amazing crowd. #DecibelFest

Gotdamn, Edmonton KILLED IT...thank you so much! Wow #AllBassesCovered
Playing Edmonton tonight.Starlite Room downtown.See you there! #AllBassesCovered
Haha thanks Winnipeg, sometimes imperfect shows are more fun! I appreciate all the love afterward, and hope to be back sooner...
Goodbye, Calgary! Hello, Winnipeg! DJ set tonight at Pyramid Cabaret.This is my first time ever playing in Manitoba, so should be sick
Headed 2 Calgary in the morning, then Winnipeg, Edmonton, Seattle, Ashland.Always been a DJ first, and it's fun to get back to my 1st love
The last three nights were nothing short of amazing...thank you Victoria B.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles.#AllBassesCovered
Rest in peace DJ Matthew Africa, a true Bay Area pioneer and friend.You are missed but will never be forgotten...
Trust I'm working hard on this set for @MIAFestival this weekend in Philadelphia...two sets in one night? Sure, why not.#AllBassesCovered
Just came up with the PERFECT catchphrase to describe my current set: ALL BASSES COVERED.I need to (P) and (C) that batch
Getting ready to head to sound check in Honolulu. I'll be DJ'ing tonight at Republik at 11pm. Contemporary beats, bass and; breaks on the menu
Touched down in Hong Kong.Set tonight and then South Korea, China, and Japan.Four countries in four days, let's go!!!
Been 6 years since I last played Sacramento, looking forward to Launch 2012 Saturday night! Set includes a world premier, among other things
The live tour is over but I have a few DJ dates coming up...it's refreshing to build a set using other people's music instead of just my own
Working on some stuff for my Low End Theory fam...it's going down this Friday in SF...
Completed a new track with the legendary Terry Reid, what an absolute HONOR...he's still got it and then some
Rest In Peace, Yauch! Condolences to the entire Beasties family.A sad day for anyone who grew up loving hip-hop
San Francisco @RegencyBallroom.@Mophono on now, then @jojomayernerve, then myself at 10pm. Final #Shadowsphere show ever. Come celebrate!
@solesides @djshadow Make it a good last show in SF tonight ! Enjoy! &lt;--- Oh, I will! Thanks for everything!
@IrnMnky have a good last shadowsphere gig mate - if ya need somewhere to keep it I can store it in the loft! &lt;---Ha! Already sorted but thx
Reno!!! I had no idea! Getting spoiled on these West Coast dates...final #Shadowsphere show EVER Saturday, San Francisco don't let me down!
Portland!!! Wow! So glad I was asked back, tonight was amazing, thank you!
And then there were three...final 3 #Shadowsphere shows ever.Portland tonight, then Reno and the big finish in San Francisco.
My home-away-from-home in Seattle?That would be The Showbox, hosting one of the final four #Shadowsphere shows tonight.Get there by 9pm!
Have to say Vancouver, that was one of my favorites of this tour, I felt great (which helps) & awesome, vocal audience (which REALLY helps)
Oh, and the great @jojomayernerve opening up on all remaining shows as well! Vancouver tonight, then Seattle, Portland, Reno, San Francisco
After a killer @Coachella2012, down to the last 5 #Shadowsphere shows ever.Tonight it's Vancouver, BC @CommodoreBallroom.5 shows, 5 days
Thanks to all involved @LevitateFestival, I had a blast! Open-minded audiences are the best kind.Next stop, @Coachella part deux
My musical tastes are always evolving, but the thing that never changes is my love for rap and hip-hop.It will always be my 'life music'
Getting ready to head to @LevitateFest here in CO, an honor to share the stage with @ruskoofficial again!
Want to say thank you to my man @Mophono for opening up for me on the last few tour dates, very inspiring musically and such a cool dude
Aspen, CO tonight.Hopefully the #Shadowsphere is gonna fit!
Back at The Depot in Salt Lake City for one last #Shadowsphere show...energy renewed from a great weekend at Coachella
Live in So-Cal? Want to see the #Shadowsphere but couldn't get Coachella tix? Last chance tonight in Ventura @majestic theatre. LATE SHOW
A lot of people are saying that they're "working on something special" for @Coachella.You can put me in that category as well.
Good stuff, @Snowbombing...smashing night of music alongside Jungle Brothers & @Zanelowe (a gentleman & scholar.) Next stop, @Coachella
You can't win 'em all...I'd settle for one, though
Gearing up to unleash two pretty insane archival projects...one "official," one thru my site.Excited about both of them for diff reasons
Just finished sound check here in Toronto.Phoenix Theater, tonight.I go on at 10pm, make sure to catch @jojomayernerve at 8:30!
Syracuse tonight! This is NOT my first time playing here, however...will explain more at show (hint: it was 1997, and Nas was the headliner)
@EngineEarz Oh, groan...I know what it is now.No, not me, but thanks 4 the heads-up.
@EngineEarz Wha??? Er, that's news to me! I'd like to be there, too. Can u email me the link?
@elmayhem Yes, it is.It's not me, it's the label...a machine that doesn't feel remorse, or pity, or fear. I will try again
Ok Boston! That was a good one. Near-perfect show for a perfect crowd. Goodnight and drive safe
Thank you NYC, see you...soon???Next up, Boston and Syracuse as the final Shadowsphere dates roll on
Heading down to @IrvingPlaza for tonight's show in NYC. Nov 2010 show there was one of my favorites, so high expectations for tonight
Great crowd tonight in MD, generous with the love (and forgiving of my nervousness.) Thank you one and all
@FrannieWTF @djshadow You should make London, UK your home away from home. &lt;--- It already is, forever and a day, til the end.
@makev_ @djshadow Last year at Rams Head was awesome, anyone opening for you tonight?? &lt;---- Yes, @jojomayernerve, they go on @8pm
Home away from home: playing The Fillmore tonight in Silver Spring, MD. First and last DC area Shadowsphere show, let's do it
Very nice to build (briefly) w @AlanTheChemist and @DJ_Muggs just before the show @Ultra. Humbling to play in the presence of my peers.
@owbmusic @ultramusic I appreciate that, thanks.
Wasn't sure what to expect, but I actually had a really good time playing @Ultra Music Festival in Miami. 1st 2012 show, felt great
Have never, ever, ever played Miami before.Ever.But that all ends on March 24th.
@EllenMclean Would love to come back to Belfast, believe me...great town. But tour ends soon
@TheMode101 @coachella Unfortunately not, too chaotic to try at festivals.Too many restrictionsThx
@Kdope50 Nuthin, same old...good to hear from you! I'm coming to NYC in about a month.How you been?
I go to these music tech conferences and all I see are Wall Street dudes running around trying to play moneyball with DJ culture.
Congratulations and respect to my good friend Jim Abbiss for his win tonight! Nice to see real talent recognized at last
Always so much fun playing 45s @Danny's in Chicago...no pretension, just really good music and a regular monthly crowd of music lovers
DAT tape was without a doubt the most fragile, unstable storage medium ever invented. Trying to salvage old masters is like defusing a bomb
Yesterday: drive is dead, files lost. This morning: after repeated tries, drive miraculously works again, files saved. Happiness restored.
There's about 8 or 9 that I love as much as anything I've heard in the last 12 months. Such an amazing result
Narrowing 400 remix entries down to 40 isn't too hard.Getting to 20 isn't bad, either.But after that, it gets reeeaaal dicey
On a global basis, I'm hoping for a lot more (good) music and a lot less economic and political tyranny in 2012
Christmas vacation always seems a little too long for me...celebrated NYE by staying home and WORKING.Gotta get these ideas down
I've got my work cut out for me on this remix contest...some very good work was done by a LOT of people.Inspirational
THANK YOU to everyone around the world who has been supporting "Scale It Back" at radio! Good music CAN win (occasionally)
Couldn't ask for a better end of the year than a sold-out show in London, where it all started for me...massive gratitude and respect
Quite possibly the final UK "Shadowsphere" show ever, tonight in London...come celebrate with @EngineEarz, @TheKnocks and myself
Great vibe at the Oxford gig tonight, was a pleasure meeting everyone at the signing afterward.Until next time!
In Oxford for show tonight at O2 Academy, stage time is 9:20...cool that 2010 remix contest participants @TigerMendoza are supporting
An absolute joy today to pull back the curtain, remove the safety net and JUST DJ!!! Total chaos, thanks 2 @boilerroomtv & @roughtradeeast
@PlugWonDeLaSoul Where in the UK were you? Did you get caught in the snow? Rip it up in Bologna fam
Newcastle, England tonight: I take the stage at 9:20pm sharpish
I started with the oldest entries and am working my way forward...rest assured EVERY mix will be heard
About 1/3 of the way through the submissions for the remix contest...hit ratio for me is about 1 out of 10 so far.A lot of nice ideas tho
I think it's safe to say that Winter has officially arrived in Glasgow! Very much looking forward to the show tonight @02ABC
Liverpool, was so nice meeting everyone after the show...lots of hardcore fans, thanks for all the support!!
Heading to sound check...show tonight in Liverpool @02 Academy, onstage at 9:20pm.Last chance to see the Shadowsphere
Going through the remixes for the "Scale It Back" remix contest...trying to limit myself to 30 or so per day to stay objective.
Leeds...thank you for being so generous with your energy and positivity.What a crowd! Respect.
The single biggest challenge facing musicians today: retaining artistic and personal dignity in an industry that rewards buffoonery
@ryanforrest82 I go on at 9:20 tonight, make sure you come for @EngineEarz at 8:15 if you can!
@DavetheBear58 Ha, that's why we do what we do...thanks for the note
@cojones1980 That would be the sensible thing to do, we're working on it! Cheers
Show tonight in Birmingham (England), but my immediate focus until then is to spend some quality time evaluating the "Scale It Back" remixes
Nottingham try to come early if you can to check out @EngineEarZ, should be a fun night...I go on at 9:30
Tonight it's Nottingham Rock City, what a privilege to still be able to play such a classic venue after all these years
Bristol show was nearly perfect...thanks to all who attended! Also thanks 2 Rise Records for allowing me 2 perform the all vinyl set earlier
Ok, back in the UK; Bristol tomorrow for not one but TWO shows, two completely different sets.Feels good to stretch as a DJ.#ILoveMyJob
Doesn't matter how low I feel...plug in those two turntables and mixer, and in that moment I know...everything's gonna be alright.
@stewartalaniz I'm now being told 11/8 is the date, so sounds like next Tuesday. As far as why, I can only surmise low man on the totem pole
@therealKidKoala Ha thanks bro, well I still haven't figured out a better way to present it live than what u saw in Montreal
@exbarman That'd be amazing, can't wait to get back!
After a few days' sick leave, working on something kind of interesting for some upcoming UK in-stores...
@Cut_Chemist Come up North man, you need to see this collection.So juiced you won that Ultra Mag special, keeping it in the family
The Shadowsphere is officially in Mexico. Guadalajara tomorrow (Friday), Mexico City Saturday. #ILoveMyJob
Are you kidding me?This World Series game 6 is a slug-fest
U get all those DJ's in one room, ur gonna learn sumthing. I learned that @Cut_Chemist is a really good chef. And Mix Trix on cassette? Wow
@JahPetz Every tour is different. Vinyl won't work when u have a lot of outdoor shows, as I have on this tour. Last tour, it was all vinyl.
@checks1 I'm on at 1am, my friend, or so I'm told.
Was great chopping it up with the homie @DJRevolution yesterday
Don't have anything to do today in Los Angeles? Then come down to @Amoebamusic, I'll be playing a short set and signing from 6pm-on.
@Lilerific @fondamusicbox I'm on at 10pm tonite.
@DanteRoss Right now it's looking like Spring '12.Played Irving Plaza last November though.
Last USA show of the year TONIGHT in Los Angeles with support from @GASLAMPKILLER.These Cali dates have been cracking, don't want it 2 end!!
Arrived in San Diego, getting ready to play tonight at 4th & B with @GASLAMPKILLER should be a good night!!
And then tomorrow in San Diego and Sunday in Los Angeles, I'm being joined by @GASLAMPKILLER should be siiiiiiccccckkkkk....
Getting ready to head out to @RegencyBallroom in San Francisco for the show tonight...I go on at 10pm but check out @TruthspeakerHQ at 9pm
@NicoleJordan @scottalk Nice.There's a bonus I'm waiting to announce as well
First-ever solo show in Santa Cruz tonight at the Catalyst.Monterey, Salinas, Watsonville, San Jose, this one's for YOU #SantaCruz
Been looking for break-beats for going on 25 years, and JUST NOW discovered one of my top three...heavy, killer, and unknown. #ItNeverEnds
Portishead comes to the Bay for the first time in over a decade, and I have a show that night across town. Life is not fair. #SchedulingFail
Proud to welcome Quannum fam @TruthspeakerHQ, opening the shows in Santa Cruz & San Francisco; stay tuned for exciting news regarding So-Cal
Just a reminder, last California dates of the year: Santa Cruz (Oct. 20), San Francisco (Oct. 21), San Diego (Oct. 22) Los Angeles (Oct. 23)
W/out family, friends, & fans, I would be lost. It's so easy to get caught up in ego & pride...with humility I strive to OWN my shortcomings
Discovering, appreciating, and sharing the music of others is what makes being a DJ so rewarding.#ILoveMyJob
First solo San Francisco show in four years: Oct. 21 @RegencyBallroom Wanna see the whole Bay there!
@EngineEarz Already in the works man, check with Nick ;-)
@EngineEarz Ha yeah it's me...dude, "They Live" is one of the gnarliest tracks I've ever heard, seriously!!
@alazenby @MutinyRadioSF Sure, I'd be happy to do that.
@JALaRochelle You will definitely hear two of them ;-)
Looking forward to this upcoming string of California dates next week: Santa Cruz, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles; then Mexico!
Beware PTADS: 'Post-Tour Adrenaline-Deficiency Syndrome'
@DEANFERNANDO: the views,response,& enthusiasm to my video for @djshadow 's track "BORDER CROSSING" has been unbelievable! thank you! ...
Brilliant end to the Asia leg of the tour, audiences in Japan are doing it BIG.Thank u #AsagiriJam #StayStrongJapan
Whoa...this crowd is HUGE.Playing in the shadow of Mt. Fuji
For me to focus on the negative is to disrespect my collaborators, my team, and my fans. I will learn from this and grow. #TLYKTB
Longest autograph signing session since '98 Unkle in-store, last night after Tokyo show.Was great to see everyone!
@tcote @numerogroup @pitchfork It's become almost comically predictable. "If I could be...who you wanted..."- T Yorke
@numerogroup @pitchfork Haha! Dude.DUDE! I can't even take it seriously anymore. Lol
New favorite pastime: making rock critics hyperventilate.ONWARD #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
So in case you missed it, we streamed just a small part of the Tokyo show live...an experiment for something much bigger planned...
@betsko Thx & to be completely honest, it stops fazing you after awhile.Everyone is entitled to their opinion.I can hold my head up high
Two shows for you this weekend, Japan: Tokyo show tonight at Blitz, 8pm.Saturday at Asagiri Jam Festival, also at 8pm.Hope 2 see u there
@HishamDahud @phontigallo High praise and good company, thx Hisham
@s_gummer Hi Sam...I really don't know why they did it that way...I try to keep my eye on everything but occasionally things slip thru.Thx
@spade_hands They wanna try to keep me in press jail...All I care about is that real fans like it. #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@phontigallo Appreciation reciprocated Phonte...Charity Starts At Home!! --&gt;This Little Dragon & @DJShadow joint has been on CONSTANT repeat
@daddydark Followed, HA!! Was great seeing you in London and thanks for making me think.Hope I can do you proud...you're an inspiration
@Mochilla: @nikalotta: 'consciously rewire, or suffer predictability'
France, Japan, Poland, and Czech Republic versions of the LP all have unique covers w the billboard text written in their native language
@economicsmusic You mean you're not scared by it?Lol.You got it!
@hiphopgods Now THAT'S a compliment that means a lot, much appreciated!
Been bouncing around the globe for so long, I have yet to even see a finished copy of the new album. Sure hope it plays in the right order
@kingmajix Sad And Lonely isn't beautiful in your opinion? Thx
@JPBBoyce Yup, it's a straight-up trap.Just happy that most hardcore fans are digging it, that's all that matters to me.Gratitude
@JohnProduces Could not have put it better myself.
Glad no one told Bambaataa he couldn't cover The MC5...or Flash that he couldn't mix Queen with Chic...Succeed or fail, DJ's yearn to learn
Since when is a DJ supposed 2 stick 2 playing or making 1 type of music? Rock critics wanna rewrite the rules...won't work. #LetTheDJDecide
@shadowygirl6 Thanks so much!! Glad to hear your thoughts
@DjAslan Thanks cousin, keep doing your thing! BTW, I was in the audience at DMC '99 (was reading your timeline) PTrix!!
@Cut_Chemist @djshadow his new record drops on my bday. Do me a solid and go pick it up. Thank you brother
@BBC6MorningShow: @djshadow Cough...*BBC 6MUSIC*...cough.
@unheard78Only if I can clear the sample...still working on it#SampleClearanceHeartbreaker
@unheard78Well said!! Especially since like 3 corporations own all the stations
Speaking of enthusiasm, the flying fist fight during "I Gotta Rokk" last night in Chengdu, China was some straight punk rock mosh pit ish
First new album in 5 years "The Less You Know, The Better" drops today in most places; I appreciate the support and enthusiasm.Long road
@danielleperry @zanelowe @RobdaBank @anniemacdjThank you, thank you!
Other "radio suckers" exceptions:NPR, @kcrw, and pretty much every college radio station.But OTHER THAN THAT...(haha)
Radio suckers never play me (applies to USA only!!!) Big shout to @zanelowe, @RobdaBank, @anniemacdj, & all others that support#gratitude
First thing I'm going to do when I get home is spend about a week just listening to/ taping new music.Time to update Shadow Radio
After 6 months on the road my sartorial game is DRAGGING.Just want to burn my whole suitcase and start over, lol
@BelfastportalOf course, that's the whole point Thanks
@toptogaAgreed, and news to me.Looking into it, ok?
@sachynsuch In a word, yes.Had to cut the cancer to save the patient.Still hope to clear it soon though.Thanks for the question
Grew up loving hardcore beats but sometimes a ballad can be even harder. Emotion is more potent than bravado if you're not afraid to use it
@adonay303 Absolutely! Guadalajara on Oct. 28th, Mexico City on Oct. 29th.
Exciting times...my first new album in 5 years.Feels great to be back. #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@HeyItsChili Me too! -&gt;&gt; looking forward to your Shanghai show tomorrow
Just realized that the album comes out TOMORROW in Australia and New Zealand.I guess they get it early, cool#TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
Wow, Taipei's scene is off the charts...amazing energy tonight! Big things happening here

I have the deepest possible gratitude for all those thru the years that have allowed me to collaborate with them...ROLL CALL
@socuttered Oct. 21, Regency Ballroom, San Francisco...think there's gonna be a Santa Cruz show as well
Thx for the feedback everyone and remember, musical diversity is not a crime (come to think of it that would make a good bumper sticker, ha)
@sadeagle Oh so maybe it works outside the US as well?I dunno dude, I just know what they tell me lol.So maybe it works everywhere!
Yeah so in the US, copies of the album sent to press had the tracks in default ALPHABETICAL ORDER....oops.An honest mistake, but damn!!
Remind me to tell you all some day about the Great Track Listing Caper...you gotta hear it to believe it!!#TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@DanteRoss Damn dude thank you! Maximum respect right back at you!! Hit me up
Let me see some pictures of people underneath the new album billboard at Amoeba L.A.!#TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@JSMartinII Astral Projection on Maverick (with promotional company flyer) among the highlights #45sInThailand
@djtonypsalms Dude you're not lying, there was a Quannum 12" for "Extravaganza" in there as well...
You nailed it.But even so, unplayed '60s garage rock 45's from Texas?Under an inch of dust? -&gt; @drknife My bet is military servicemen.
The psychic migration of vinyl never ceases to astound me. Found some stuff today in Thailand that defies explanation; how did it get here??
@thisisjohnbook Hi John. I read it, and I thank you.I am at peace with my successes, my failures, and ultimately, myself.
Ok, so I have a new album coming out in like 9 days.First new album in 5 years.I invite your attention 2 this space over the coming days
I know I am terrible at social networking.I choose to focus my limited time and energy on the music I make.Pls forgive my shortcomings
Going on at 10pm tonight @Demo in Bangkok, Thailand
Take a look at your "I Gotta Rokk" vinyl.If it has marbled 'splash wax,' you have something very rare on your hands...
In 2011, if you're not making uber-pop, fan support is not only necessary, it's absolutely essential.Thanks 2 every1 for supporting so far
Yes, Singapore!! Great show tonight @Zouk, thanks to everyone for treating us so well
Found a vintage 8mm print of 'That Man Bolt' today at a thrift market in Jakarta. #ilovemyjob
Momentum is a difficult thing to quantify, but there seems to be a pulse here, which makes me hopeful
Getting ready to sound check in Manchester.Final UK/Europe show before the album comes out... the last two weeks have been fantastic.
Thank you @robdabank, excellent time @Bestival tonight!
Arrived at Bestival, so many talented people here...great to see @DJ Krush, @DJ Fresh, @Mark Pritchard

Getting ready to sound check in Cardiff...first show in Wales in 15 years!! Last time was opening for Radiohead...damn, time flies
What a relief, so nice to play to an appreciative audience...nothing makes me feel better than seeing girls on shoulders @ElectricPicnic
30 minutes til show.Santigold just came off, crowd dug her a lot.Nervous about the new stuff I added, no chance to rehearse it
No matter where I go in the world, the temperature drops 10 degrees the moment I land...everyone on the tour calls me 'Mr. Freeze'
Getting ready to fly to Dublin via Chicago for this year's last Irish date @Electric Picnic...played there 5 years ago, 1 of my favorites
A rare day off today in New Orleans...no place I'd rather be
Was great catching up with Sway today on Shade 45, Sirius...good people for real

Seems like Europe is on the job, time to see what Canada and the States are talking about...first stops Calgary and Edmonton, two new stops
Saving the best for last? Two killers near the end of the tour, first at Glastonbury and tonight, courtesy thousands going mad in Brussels
If it's possible to have the perfect Glastonbury experience, I've just had it.A monumental privilege to play in the memory of John Peel
Playing John Peel stage tonight at Glastonbury...what a profound honor

@thisisjohnbook: RECORD CRACK: Did you score the limited edition 12" single @DJShadow posted last week? I did, and here's my review....
Checking out an LP given to me in Portugal by a group called "Orelha Negra..." Very solid, very soulful...might have to play on Shadow Radio
Finally signed all those remix CDs, sorry for the wait everyone...
Dropping a few pieces of the new wax off at Soul Jazz & Phonica in London tomorrow...
Coping with 'post-tour adrenalin deficiency' by checking out all of the music given to me at shows...CD's and vinyl...good stuff.Impressed
@jrocc "you need to send one my way...thanks"&lt; Haha I'll set one aside with your name on it!!
Bulgaria: got a chance to hit James Lavelle and Remi (Gorillaz Sound System) off with copies of the new 12"...trying to give it to DJ's only

Tomorrow is Prague, then Budapest, Bratislava (Slovakia), and Bulgaria...also just heard we might be going back to Ireland later this year!
Looking forward to Antwerp tonight...Open Air Amphitheater, under the stars...might give away some new vinyl during the show, we'll see.
Playing at Kaserne in Basel, Switzerland tonight at MIDNIGHT.See you there!!
Took a stroll around Lisbon, Portugal during some down time; playing the Sudoeste Festival tonight, first time in 11 years!
Learned a lot about Ibiza; there's more to the island than what you see in the media. Thanks to everyone who helped make my intro a success
Tomorrow is my first ever set in Ibiza...yes, you read that correctly!! Hopefully providing an antidote to the usual club same old thing...
Domaize, France: thousands of EXTREMELY enthusiastic youths in a field, jumping up and down to Organ Donor...what more could a DJ ask for?
Thanks Den Haag, Utrecht, Eindhoven...there's a movement in Holland for sure! See you next year.Tonight is Domaize, France...
@JWDijk @l33chbert @jwalphenaar Thanks, was nice to play in a city outside of Amsterdam for a change...I think tonight will be great
Who else thinks primusluta's version of "Broken Levee Blues" would be PERFECT for an episode of "The Treme?"
DJ Shadow Remix Project CD's FREE with any T-shirt at all Holland shows while they last (Eindhoven, Utrecht, Den Hague)...see you tonight!!
@Shortkut @OaklandFaders I see you family!! DJ unity in effect
@PerryDJames Thanks for the praise! It was hot and super late in the morning, glad you were still energized

@chaz_c99 When Thrawn loses his cool, you better start watching yourself.
@PraiseColonel It was great to see those two meet, wasn't it?
@TScottBrave Ezra's pretty happy they were included, too. Collecting for the win!
@landscalrissian: I have goosebumps because of the music that was playing when Thrawn was speaking. Wow. #StarWarsRebels
@TScottBrave Always two, there are. ;-) Enjoy the episode!
A brave, but foolish Scout Trooper. #StarWarsRebels
Our east coast live-tweet of  Heroes starts now. #StarWarsRebels
@TylerImmortal Obi-Wan told us to tell you that you are lost.
@JoshuaBegley1 We're just happy you could make it. :-)
@AmyWishman For Krennic's sake, we certainly hope not.
@chafos Mass hysteria of the finest kind, Chase. Stay tuned.
@whoshooz But Simon, the trailer is calling to you...
@VskylerT Sounds like it's time to bring hope to the office, Skyler.
@MatiasCastanon They aren't Republic credits, are they? Because those are no good out here.
@Alex_Quevedo There is a 97.6% chance of that being projected by you.
@geektrooper You'll love his dancing to Debarge's "Rhythm of the Night" even more.

Fans of a certain battle droid from @Chuck Wendig's Aftermath series will love the upcoming project from @CharlesSoule. :-)
The breadth of Star Wars fandom, from con-goers to his mom, always amazes @kierongillen. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
Timothy Zahn hopes to write for Palpatine again one day. @CharlesSoule would like a chance at Luke Skywalker. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
The character @ek_johnston really hopes to write for? Sabine Wren. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon #StarWarsRebels
Han Solo for @ChuckWendig, who refers to Solo's complexity. For Timothy Zahn, it's not a specific character, it's Star Wars in general.
Characters you're afraid to write? Boba Fett for @KieronGillen. Ahsoka for @EK_Johnston. Palpatine for @CharlesSoule. #NYCC #NYCC2016
Writing a story that measures up to Star Wars is always a challenge, says Lando writer @ChuckSoule. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
"I keep coming back to how fun it is." -Ahsoka author @ek_johnston on the appeal of Star Wars. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
A small group of people making a difference against enormous odds continues to inspire @ChuckWendig. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
The Empire Strikes Back was @KieronGillen's first Star Wars movie, which means he's writing the prologue to his own saga entry point.
The aspect of generational cycles inspires @ChuckWendig, even more so moving into The Force Awakens' era.
Between A New Hope and; The Empire Strikes Back, @CharlesSoule's father would make up bedtime stories about Star Wars that continued the saga.
What about Star Wars do the writers find inspiring? James Luceno is inspired by the music, even listening to multiple versions.
James Luceno names Elmore Leonard and Thomas Pynchon. Ahsoka author @ek_johnston enjoys Anne McCaffrey. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
Currently, @ChuckWendig is reading The Expanse, and was influenced by the writer to his right, Timothy Zahn. #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
First question: Who are your biggest influences, and what are you reading right now? #NYCC #NYCC2016 #BookCon
@MediocreJedi The look on your Padawan's face is intense!
@tj_nix @HasbroNews You've got to find the map first.

@Tallguyalec Don't sell the mention of shatterpoints in Revenge of the Sith novelization short... ;-)
@jbrauning @StarWarsGames It helps to not be "sanctioned" if you lose.
@NickDiCo @StarWarsGames That Kasan Moor mission was really something.
@fairmegwyn Really? And what does @quigonsmith have to say about this?
@brillynch Search your feelings, you'll know which one is your true choice.
@quigonsmith Deplorable excess of personality... especially for a mathematician.

@SirBenKenobi @SW_Celebration absolutely! Fans who can't attend in person can still enjoy the event via live stream.
@trippdigital You gotta remember where the keys to your TIE are somehow, right?
@SurfGuy808X If there's a more perfect description of Hondo... we don't know what it is. :-)
@StarWarsGames: We giving away 40 #StarWarsBattlefront Bespin DLC codes for @Playstation 4 and @Xbox starting today!
Which #TheForceAwakens character would you invite to your #IndependenceDay barbecue? #StarWarsAsks
@RedFireSmedis Especially when they're hungry, right?
@CBeheler That smile at the end of Revenge of the Sith didn't make him seem too sad about what happened, did it?
@VicsCantina We promise, no Jawas were harmed in the making of this delicious smoothie... right, @JustJenn?
@papperbokwriter You know what they say, Pride goes before a (loooooong) fall (down a reactor shaft).
@papperbokwriter Palpatine? Overconfident? Never! ;-)
@bnystedt We advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive... to confiscate your homemade ice cream.
@GamersBlogX But... The Embrace of Pain... ouch.
@Mercenum With your presence, perhaps things would change? "Always in motion is the future."
#StarWarsAsks: Which time in the galaxy far, far away's history would you want to take part in? Why?
@JaegerRaven #RogueOne ain't kidding when it comes to capes and cloaks...
@deweyk95 Hey! Threepio always gets the passengers there safely... right? 
@Bencharmanart We love one of your Vines and we want to feature it on The Star Wars Show. Can you DM us to let us know if that's cool?
@sleeplessknYght May the Force be with you, Keith!
@WhoOrDie Face to face with Darth Vader... and she talks back to him? Brave, indeed.
@thekelseycole @DisneyParks @WaltDisneyWorld As you do.
Looking to learn the ways of the Force? You need a teacher! But who? #StarWarsAsks
@thenegotiatoryt For a safe and secure weekend...
@Kamiduu @SealTeam_Shels @HamillHimself We'd expect them to be cleaned up before dinner. Cancel any Tosche Station plans...
@scottykscooter @JohnBoyega Did you alert the First Order?
@bfisch14 @amritkdeol Yeah, but who's gonna fly it, you?
@8BITNIXON Word in Jabba's palace is that he's quite a conversationalist.
@TeaToastParis Have you forgotten the incident with the bosses heyblibber?
@Garbuttus He's really enjoying himself, isn't he?
@TeaToastParis Make sure your space cruiser is insured...
@nelson_1jr You'll have to challenge @AngusMacLane to a game of Sabacc for it. 
@DelReyStarWars: Just finalized plans for new original shorts in @SW_Insiderthis year. Authors/details to come later, but def a great
@Facetious_man That could make office interactions awkward...
@antonypin8 Depends, Antony. Republic credits are no good out here. And the last time we took a trip to Coruscant, C-3PO ended up driving...
@swartzyJ General Hux appreciates that one, Jacob.
@KrypTo891 Coruscant's citizens mourn Hosnian Prime, but are glad Starkiller Base never got the chance to turn its weapon toward them.
@JamesMAustin94 If the Grand Vizier's in a good mood, why not?
@FerHaus1 We're happy you enjoyed it! @swankmotron does great work.
#StarWarsQuestionOfTheWeek: What color would your lightsaber be?
@TruthFinderJ832 That's cold, Joshua, son of Nun.
@KruszynskiAdam It may be too late for Alderaan, Adam... :-(
@bnystedt Maybe Jabba will spring for one? Just don't stand directly in front of him when you ask...
@BombRob12 Good luck, Rob. Though we would've expected your coffee to be a bit more on the dark side. 
@PetrosMiliopoul Platform 327. But if you're trying to save Han, there's still a chance at the east platform.

@SkiTrickster @FFGames Taylor. These are your first steps...
@ItsLiviaChu @Disneyland Say hi to Chewie at Launch Bay for us!
@RichardHoekstra @dan_brooks Meditate on this, you should.
@LitNicky @dan_brooks Notice the next time Luke is standing on his hands Yoda is standing firmly on the ground?
@degobabe Will you be at the rendezvous point on Tatooine?
@djheather @whathifi Truly, truly, truly outrageous.
@ShadyReviewer Double the pleasant conversation, in their case.
@paul_pisano That's a great point, Paul, but would Anakin have believed him?
@WilliamShatner Captain, please. The general may need some time.
@AsherFeltman Well, you certainly can't "try" to... ;-)
@ALupi15 Gonna be a lot of days like that, Andrew. :-)
@ThePalGals Not a day over, "a long time ago..."
@HanktheSWFan We'll accept your explanation... this time. ;-)
@_ObiMoo @NerdsOnHoliday How else are you going to be ready when a Sith Lord attacks? :-)
@stacylondon Happy Birthday! And may the Force be with you.
@blendersports The Force works in mysterious ways, Sara.
@mapplebee7567 Your aunt Julie sounds wizard, Matthew. :-)
@SeanTheBaptiste @ShawnHalwes You get THX sound in there? ;-)
@theCarrieNugent Thanks for joining us on the adventure, Carrie (great name, btw).
@twesthause So your parents trained you for your first steps... like a Jedi.
@holonet242 Star Wars AND Jaws? You're going to need a bigger screen...
@LinktheJedi We think pretty highly of crazy old man wizards around here, Huss. 
@n_kydd We prefer the term, "One with the Force."
@jason_phelps @Velothon @mssocietyuk May the Force be with you, Jason!
@TheWookieeRoars: Thank you for the birthday wishes! I appreciate them more than I can say!!
@jaa0109 Ooh, that's definitely one to ponder! A maverick Jedi with an equally maverick apprentice. The possibilities...
@A13X5T3PH3N5 It doesn't take over a thousand years to digest, does it? ;-)
@NCWIT: Fiction Reel WiT Award Winner Rey of @starwars embodies the ingenuity and confidence of a positive role model. Congrats! #NCWITs
@TheStarWarsGuru How closely did she match up with what you'd imagined?
@StayVndrTheTide A happier ending than the other Episode III... ;-)
@TheStarWarsGuru @CHVRCHES Thanks, Steve! What segment was your favorite?
@TheFirstRebel We're working to make the link fully operational as we speak.

@StayVndrTheTide The full piece will be shared in the next few days. Stay tuned!
@SWFanAttic Not all of our guests will be tied to making Star Wars, but all are fans and; we talk about that. Every week will be different!
@vvvvgeorgevvvv "That's good! You've taken your first steps into a larger world." -Obi-Wan Kenobi
@SoQuixotical Congratulations! He looks like a great co-pilot.
@hedgewitchs The pet store's the place that Dani was at, buying a light saber for her cat!
@JoshReubenking He's there to put you back on schedule.
@justjenn But don't you feel it? The call to the lite?
@Pat_M514 Through victory, your chains are broken.
@JediManda We'd keep Ser Gregor away from Vader if we were you.
@MarioMurgueitio The Force. Binding the galaxy together since 1977. :-)
@BrookeRasmusen: Since today is #MayThe4thBeWithYou you can correctly assume I listened to the Star Wars soundtracks on repeat.
@TylerChadney: 1 get off work. n2. Binge watch #StarWars for the rest of the night #MayThe4thBeWithYou #StarWarsDay
@BJSebastian "Pass on what you have learned." -Yoda

@CapnMrly We weren't notified, Clint. We'll have to check it out.
@ThethingsIsaid @501stLegion No blasters, though, right? :-)
@Danimator_ Tap and hold the sticker to reposition it. Those droids will be on your shoulder (or wherever you want them) in no time. :-)
@iMac1975 Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen. Congratulations, Ian!
@ashleybarfoot24 Clearly, the Force is calling to you. :-)
@alphachetsoup Pass on what you have learned, Chester! :-)
@__e8__ Your little dark sider looks adorably dangerous.
@tweetwithLC When 900 viewings you reach, enjoy it as much, you will.
@zanemichaelj @levithiele @VANS_66 And a galaxy far, far away.
@BradBlackman @wesleywhamond @amy_geek Exciting times! These are their first steps...
@ZackRyder @EmmaWWE @WaltDisneyWorld Best to just take the picture. We don't think Kylo will respond well to a Broski Boot.
@BelleRinger1 @HamillHimself @carrieffisher @JohnBoyega Clearly, the Force is strong in your family. You have it. Your sister has it.
@LeeServenti Looks like that baby's got a few surprises left in her, too.
@danielthelion Nothing else in life is certain, Daniel.
@davefeinman Double your efforts. Get things done while it's on in the background. :-)
@TheAcidWolf @darthvader @bobafett No disintegrations.
@thepetfiles We think she wants you to go the Dagobah system.
@hitchinsIV @JohnBoyega Truly wonderful, the mind of your child is, Charles.
@smithpunk2016 @HamillHimself Promise. Promise us you will train the boy.
@GordytheFerret @Petco Rest you need. Yes, rest.
@Mystic_warrior So many amazing moments ahead of you! You've taken your first steps into a larger world.
@MarissaCalcione @OriginalFunko No hanging around out back waiting for us to take out the trash, either, Marissa.
@asilva_10 @EA @EAStarWars The kind of scoundrel you'd like.
@coreyjcarter @LEGO_Group Here's hoping your desk has insurance. #DontMakeHimAngry
@geektrooper @EAStarWars You warmup? You, sir, are a true soldier.
@Mystic_warrior Happy to hear you're enjoying it, Michelle. What episode are you on?
@caitlin_hahn @OriginalFunko @JohnBoyega That's awesome! But he needs a pilot...
@Anto_Il_Barone And it's about to awaken your Blu-ray player!
@andryana_ @TheHeatherH That's great, Andryana! Don't get cocky. :-)
@Anthony3Draxler Glad to hear it, Anthony. What mode is your favorite?
The Force was strong at tonight @MTV #MovieAwards. Congratulations Daisy, Adam and; the entire #TheForceAwakens cast and; crew for their wins!
@HamillHimself: People ask all the time:"Was it fun doing those movies?" As this clip proves- It was never NOT fun! #GalacticGiggles htt
@thechief2gaming That term has not been used in canon.
@Bishopebrown That sounds like an awesome weekend. :)
@HamillHimself: Pretty sure I don't have any lines in this one either #RogueWonderful #HurryUpDecember #ReturnOfTheATATS #WOWZA! htt
@Iceman525 @diegoluna_ The possibility of that happening are approximately 3,720 to 1.
@LonelyProbe It's a long trip. You're entitled to a break every now and then.
@timpstratton And now #RogueOne! It's the best time to be a fan.
@DanielKennedyDK Capes. In style in a galaxy far, far away since 1977.
@JeremyJahns It certainly motivates the Rebels to run.
@kristenlongg That story will continue with Episode VIII. Rogue One is a different story, set right before A New Hope.
@KeremGogus: It's also great to see @ForestWhitaker and @DonnieYenCT on @starwars my two most favorite actors. #RogueOne #RogueOneAStarW
@The_Wyldcard It's not "another" Death Star. It's THE Death Star. This is the story of how the Rebels obtained the plans before A New Hope.
@CGCJ123 @dave_filoni He mentioned that he liked the idea of it, not that it was confirmed to be true.
@HamillHimself: SHOW YOUR FORCE! #HamillionWasFun but this REALLY matters!!! Donate and; we'll match up to $1M! #ForceForChange #Thanks htt

@MattCool7 Sorry! But you can watch it anytime on demand after the chat is over.
@KY10REY It most definitely will. You can watch anytime on demand after the chat concludes.
@Willzinator It's 6:30am PDT/9:30am EDT/1:30pm GMT.

@kyle_newman @HerUniverse @dave_filoni AWESOME! The blank is for awesome, right?
@leifwells: No kidding. That episode requires a second viewing. Wow!n#StarWarsRebels
@Imputations "Twice the pride, double the fall." He definitely underestimated Kanan's connection to the Force.
@billytagg: Darth Vader breathing. Is there any other sound more wonderfully terrifying? #StarWarsRebels
@maria_c_stuckey: This #StarWarsRebels finale is only half over and it is AMAZING.

@LucasSiegel: Tonight episode of #StarWarsRebels just NAILS it. Best droid-centric episode Lucasfilm Animation has ever produced.
@foczyzie No worries. We get a ton of questions about it and; work hard to make sure it's fair/transparent. Already planning updates for 2017!
@foczyzie No. Returning characters' seeds are determined by last year's results. Matchups follow a standard single elimination pattern.
@karon @AgentM These were made through a partnership with the designer and Disney.
@RealMFrancis @HerUniverse The season is not over. We just had a week off, but are back with a new episode tomorrow night!
@bobafettfanclub All matches start at 10am Mon-Fri.
@BlueJaigEyes @iheartbiscuits We don't set matches intentionally. Rank is based on last year results and; follow standard single elim. pattern.
@2beers2nerds Not done to fit an agenda. Seeding is set by a character's performance in previous year with new characters at the lowest spots.
@JoeyFerenchick She could open the doors, but didn't out of respect. The temple is a sacred Jedi place and; she is no longer a Jedi.
@themovielord Everyone plays in the first round. They are the light/dark top seeds, so they are matched with the bottom ranked characters.
@NickelodeonTV: The Force is strong with this film--this year's Favorite Movie award goes to Star Wars: The Force Awakens! Hey there, Ch
@FlashThompson16 @getfandom So, in short, that's just kind of how it worked out. Not intentional.
@FlashThompson16 @getfandom Character rankings are set by last year's performance and; match ups follow a standard single-elimination pattern.
@samnotscott Purely coincidence. As Obi-Wan would say, we're "not brave enough for politics."
@PendantAmaranth Nope. That's an early Artoo, but this concept definitely influenced Chopper's design as well!
@MarsCuriosity: The Force is strong with this one. #BB8 learns of @NASA's #JourneyToMars from my test double in @NASAJPL's #MarsYard htt
#WisdomWednesday - "The path of ignorance is guided by fear." (The #CloneWars 4.8)
@danalexhales17 Not guards specifically, but they do have ties to the Order... it's possible they were Padawans, Knights we hadn't met etc.
@chasadavis @missingwords Character rankings are based on last year's results and; the match ups follow a standard single elimination pattern.
@Ledgendari Revan's Black Series figure is being made because it was the winner of a Fan Choice poll last year.
@AnthonyC_Adams Nope. That was the voice of The Inquisitor, @jasonsfolly.
@gosty977 Asajj Ventress' story is told in the Dark Disciple novel. We haven't covered Cody since the Clone Wars.
@pjamesfallon They have ties to the Order in some way, the exact connection varies. He was a guard, some may have been Padawans etc.
@FocasciousMe Mainly just a style change, but it helps to transition the Yoda we see in TCW/prequel era with how we see him in Empire.
@Raekyn She still has a strong connection to the Force, she's just not a Jedi.
@Myzticlive She wasn't. She was going off on another mission that we haven't learned about yet.
@whostheplatypus They still haven't found it... the search continues.
@josiah4311 Yes, it moves. We've seen it near Alderaan, Yavin and; Endor in just the movies.
@Inquis_ector: That scene with #DarthVader and the #Stormtroopers entering the Jedi Temple was a thing of beauty, dark beauty. nn#StarW
@Staticdash22 Well, she did make the final decision to walk away from the Order. She's had a while to come to terms with that.

@SlymDayspring12 No episodes are "throw away episodes." They all have a reason.

#WisdomWednesday - "You hold onto friends by keeping your heart a little softer than your head." (The #CloneWars 1.7)
@IanClow18 No. It's 1 hour long. 2 episodes back to back.
@4thsniper It's a Lasat exclamation, usually used in times of distress or frustration. It doesn't have a direct translation.
@xInspPenguinX This series is meant as an introduction for people new to Star Wars, so it covers the more prominent members of the category.

@Elrodvo432 Because she's off doing work of her own.
@Elrodvo432 She did in A Princess on Lothal... but can't do it often - or be too obvious - because it would endanger Alderaan.
@Nivlacanator As Captain of the Honor Guard Zeb was well known among Lasat and; Kallus has definitely has history with them.
@CTopherDavies: Great to see some development on the villain characters in #StarWarsRebels Agent Kallus has a exciting plot line to come!
@SamRTheIII It's safe to assume that it could, but he doesn't know about it.
@Decepticon17 Awesome! TARKIN also gives a lot of cool depth to the Grand Moff.
@Goodie1969: This episode of #StarWarsRebels "The Honorable Ones" is one of my favorites so far. Wondering what Kallus is thinking at th

@Decepticon17 We recommend checking out Lost Stars. It's a fantastic book.
Chopper will gladly go take care of that droid. #StarWarsRebels
@MeltyArtz: Well, all I've got to say is that David Oyelowo is an incredibly impressive voice actor. Really believable. #starwarsrebels
@Paul_Hadsall It would violate his sense of honor.
@FallonKlivian: "What a day we're having." - Heran"Day...week...year...life..." - Kanan, probably. #StarWarsRebels

@DeShawnO Glad you like it! What's your favorite track?
@RPrincess2015 It's just the way he is. The Force is expressed in many different ways by different users.
@ishaan_nigam12 Ahsoka did get farther in her training. She is also a few years older than Kanan.
@hRXQN5J3VNfer5Q It's just a style change between shows.
@fishinforcarrie It can be animated. All of that info can be found on the page we linked to.
@ALupi15: Woah. Hera's accent slipping in and out during the episode is such an amazing touch. Shows the pain she's hiding #StarWarsRebe

@FairlightEx: Out for dinner with everyone from the @ForHonorGame event.nnI requested the table farthest away from any edges or cliffs.
@AlexTiff @MightyMouseUFC lol I appreciate that. Really hope I wasn't annoying cause there are a lot of moments I am.
@AlexTiff @MightyMouseUFC I felt bad for talking so much lol cause I know I'm a shadow in the presence of these superstars.
@AlexTiff @MightyMouseUFC he did but it was an honor to get rekt by him ;)
So for honor gave me a comp to stream and practice on a bit before the event. Might be live In a sec but it's one monitor.
Landed in LA for the For Honor event. I scratched my eye...Might be wearing an eyepatch

@Vitaceous my TV is broken still and so I've been playing with this cat for over an hr and I wanted to spread his cuteness across the land
@GoldGloveTV @comcastcares why can't fiber be everywhere?
@Brad_1031 @Sony It's heavy, we didnt take it out of the box, inspect it a whole bunch then mount it, just got it mounted up right away.

Christmas time is the time to buy other people stuff, and an excuse to buy urself a whole bunch of shit as well :)
@Twisted411 My partners told me they play worse on stream, im just not gonna risk it, hopefully i can Q soon.
TFW 1 game away from Rank 1 in 3v3 and ur DK sits a 1 min loading screen right before Q pops. Missed Q, lost game.
@sadebabe22 Lol Finn is doing extremely well, hes walking around now and no longer need to be watch over 24/7 :D. Just never going outside.
@curseapp: Curse video calls let you connect with your friends all over the world. See your favorite people anytime - while gaming or ju
@Phytom3 Yea we got it all up and running but i dont wanna turn on my stream again at this pt just to stream for 30 min. That's weird.
@watchmedot Not this Saturday, but maybe next, depends on if good games came out that week to make for a good stream.
Okay im at the dentist. @NickPolom is at home fixing my pc while i get my teeth drilled. God lets hope nothing goes wrong on either end. :(
TFW you upgrade to windows 10, and half ur shit is gone :(
I need to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, it's causing tons of issues, so it might be an hr or so before I can stream.
Im tryg to setup my emulator with @Blazeror atm for Retro Shit Show Saturday N64, it's being really fking annoying, going live when it works
Im flying home now. Back to Austin here i cum. Wont be able to stream til saturday tho. Dont forget to recommend games pls for SSS
Just got called a puss-ass by @LegendaryLeaTV uncle. Things are going well so far for Thanksgiving :).
Had to follow Lea around three different grocery stores for T-day ingredients. Man shout out to all the hard working grocers this week.
Waiting on a cable to show up for my webcam and getting a haircut then i can go live.
@Ultimaflarestar @LegendaryLeaTV hes gonna be in a crate for the next 6 weeks. Cant move much cause of his spine.
Vet took forever and im spending some time with Finn today, hes doing well :).
@Mylifecliff still at vet. When i get home ima be playing wow
@PridePlayz @YouTube so many other things id rather do than watch that.

My friends @EmiScotty and Gills are getting married today so no stream! See you all tmrw for shit show saturday.
Finn has a fractured spine. Taking him to surgery today. No stream.
@Sodapoppintv he was found in the backyard meowing and unable to stand up. Dont know what happened yet.

I'll be live in a bit, gonna relax and play WoW, and then Battlerite tonight with @NickPolom
I might stream today it just rly fucking hurts to speak atm.
i slept in peeps and im not streaming 2day. My mouth is all fucked up and its rly hard to talk. As u can imagine thats rly bad 4 streaming.
Getting food before i stream to avoid what happened yesterday.
@SCJose2 @AxlRose21434675 @korpopgaming @MitchJonez lol hes a troll dude. Browse his tweets. Hea a god troll. Already got me.
@Gborzz_ its an entirely different game. Some ppl dont enjoy legion. They're very passionate about it and really want their voice heard.
@AxlRose21434675 wow. Where do u get ur drugs and tinfoil hats dude? I want some of those.
@ericarcand1987 @Alexensual yep ur right. U know me too well.
@WeeTommy_ ill unignore u in my chat if u guess it right.
I feel like i never browse twitter except when i have nothing better to do lol. Such as sitting in an airport or pooping.
@Reinholt12 lets hope it lasts for a long time :)
@athene9881 why is it not possible that i REALLY wanted legacy when WoD was shit?
@JarheadReynolds @NostalBegins didnt pack it. I didnt take my time with packing at all. Grabbed a jacket and 3 random shirts.
@Jairoyify lol i do too. Its legit a diff game from legion. Im fortunate enough to love both luckily
@AxlRose21434675 @WallanderEUW @CerneaCM @hakon272 holy fk this is a retarded statement. I had WoW teams while pushing legacy in WoD LOL.
@CerneaCM @hakon272 like dude i want legacy but ur embarrassing ppl supporting the want for legacy by being this stupid. Stop it please
@CerneaCM @hakon272 but because im. Not harrassing devs, or posting constant youtube videos about it now because im not as passionate as u
@CerneaCM @hakon272 i voiced my opinion and want for legacy. And i wanted blizzard to recognize that it is wanted. I still want it,
@CerneaCM @hakon272 i gave my word to do something?
@hakon272 @CerneaCM legacy would be good right NOW even. Im just not interested in putting a ton of effort in pushing legacy. Idc atm.
@hakon272 not really that much actually. Still want it but im not as diehard as others atm. Legion entertains me 10 hrs a day.

@Warcraftjen @BajheeraWoW as a recent house shopper i love it!
@LegendaryLeaTV: We did it! $1500 raised for the @NationalBCFDN ! Thank you so much to everyone who contributed and @Celest565 for organ
@Supatease I guess when I go into someones stream for the first time, I sit there for 5 min looking for simple stuff, like health bars lol.
Being a viewer in the WoW section has to be so annoying considering every streamer has a completely different overlay.
What is your fav WoW PvP video of all time? I'm curious to see what some of you think :)
LF someone to make a WoW addon that removes everyone from RL ID except ppl with notes on their name. Streamers will love you forever!
Any plans to make a portal @ the end of each dungeon that teleports u to the beginning to help ppl who can't remember to reset? @BlizzardCS
No SSS tmrw, no excuse other than really not in the mood to do it and I would rather just not do it than have a bad SSS.
Why is there a legendary that buffs Storm Earth and Fire, but monks don't spec Storm Earth and Fire cause it's bad. Any plans? @BlizzardCS
@Sodapoppintv It's a meme, this is what my Gleader said to all of us a couple of night ago. LOL.
or so. And I will be looking at people I can definitely replace. This is disgraceful.
Thats it for the night, you all should be ashamed of yourself this is fucking pathetic. I'm going to be going over logs for another hour
I have been informed that my legendary is literally worthless cause the spell it buffs is buggy and u don't even want to spec it. WTF
No stream today, gonna go Kayaking :). nSee you all tmrw.
WoD was fun for one month, then it turned to shit.nIt's been over a month since Legion released, and I still love it.

@NatashaSoupy_ sarcasm doesn't do very well in text without emotes etc.
@kolarov1391 average demographic for twitch is over 21. Mine for example is 18+. Completely different worlds.

I am still super sick. Im sorry for missing my meet and greet today but i cant leave the hotel room.
Im stuck in this hotel shitting and throwing up. This twitchcon sucks so far. But @LegendaryLeaTV is taking care of me thank god.
I might wanna head home and stream and just take a whole bunch of those free subs from twitch prime :).

@CelebriannTV @NickPolom I literally told you he wasn't there and he was staying at his hotel. LOL.
So @timthetatman said he was going on the balcony. We went there to find him and hangout. Turns out he was downstairs. Tims a liar.
@Arclegger @GiantWaffle @FemSteph @GoldGloveTV Woah, that was below the belt right there Arc.
Everytime I hold down Right Click on my mouse and try to turn my camera in WoW, everything freezes...any ideas how to fix? Using Scimitar.
Im gonna skip twitchcon next year and just stay home and stream and just take in ALL the viewers cause theyll have no one else to watch.
Just woke up guys lol im sorry i just straight up overslept . :/

No stream today, all the games this week on steam are bad, and I'm gonna try to spend time with family today that I havn't seen in years.
Thinking I might skip SSS again, these games that came out this past week or so, really are not that great... =/
Internet is back finally, but im gonna just do SSS requests, i need to get my mythics done tonight and i dont have enough time to stream it.
Talked to the twc guy he said he doesnt know why my internet went out hes trying to fix it now. Pray.
Literally the worst time for my internet to go out. Again.
I love that there is literally ALWAYS something to do at the moment in Legion. God I love this feeling I get when I just NEED to login WoW.

I never expected some of it to come to light and half the stuff was random bullshit that i said to fill the void of silence.
Not a lot brings me to tears, but im so disappointed in myself and how i talked about other people today behind their back.
Literally no service atm, i ran down the street to get this tweet out.
@MitchJonezeeee pokemon go dawg. Im abut to head out

Okay, what was the name of the charity that i did for a stream for months ago? I cannot find it...LOL.
@Zarrona13 90% of the stuff on that reddit is stupid, but people can be justifiably upset, it's been too long and it looks bad.
@stupo564 It's not my money. It's from a charity stream i did months ago.
Today, I completely organize my disgusting room. Then send $20,000 to charity. Those two tasks will probably take ALL day. nHere we go.

Rushing my ass to Dreamhack now. Let's fkin gooooooo
Yea I'm going to bed now. I refuse to stream at dh on 3 hrs of sleep so I'll be a bit late. Gonna at least get 7 hrs or so.
Lot of bitches at my house atm. Prob gonna b a bit late tmrw but let's hope not :/.
@iamvhell @Rzn732 Oh that would own. But who could make this addon in less than 30 min? LOL.
@iamvhell @Rzn732 I dont think u can 5 man Molten Core...but who knows.
This fridge just got plugged in so it's really loud trying to get nice and cold, my mic picks it up so gotta wait for it to get quiet.
More insurance shit im dealing with, Live in a bit.
@DaleStangoe In order for notes to popup on stream?
So I downloaded the paypal info from Jan. 3rd (Charity stream event) Literally the first transaction of $6500, was refunded. LOL. wow.
My past tweets were a mistake. Wuss a bit shwasted
I'll be live in a bit just gonna take a sec. Bunch of phone calls had to do and take dogs to vet. Now computer is being built by nick.
Had a bit of a car accident, no it was not my fault. We're all fine, I'll explain what happened on stream later.
People don't realize that being as cucked as I am it's a full time job.
If legacy servers were to be released, would you do any changes to it? Such as update the UI, fix minor bugs? What would you do? I'm curious
@Dory: Three stages of life:nn1.Birthn2. W H A TT H EF U C KI ST H I Sn3. Death
@R0bicus close Twitter , close all social media. U do NOT want this spoiled
@forslitherskin1 @Borisdiabetes Agreed, I'd really want status texts in enemy health bars, I'd like to see casts, etc.
@Borisdiabetes Probably not tbh. I dont even use the new models in retail.
@NostalBegins @Blizzard_Ent I swear to god if it's anything positive about the creation of legacy servers I'll cry.
@NostalBegins: Dev team promised you something special... more information tomorrow :)
@MrZappa8 @queenelbi No one cares bro. Don't like my tweets anymore? Grow up, move on and get a life (or follow someone elses twitter) Jesus
@warlorth @Dansgaming @LIRIK @TwitchSupport Same is happening to me. :(
@BurningPaladin That's something I'm all for, but I don't think they would want that lol. That's for them to decide.
@GrumpyGrizzly90 @WowKungen Woah, maybe...idk, i feel like all we can do is wait at the moment. But sounds like it would still be fun :)
@miragegame Id love to stream anything you guys currently have available, DM me on twitter whenever :)
@Grummz I always read em it just doesn't ever bother me. Twitch chat is 10x more savage.
@Grummz you shouldn't be on the Internet otherwise. Worst thing is people who dish it out and can't take it. That's the worst LOL.
Got ready to stream EU friendly. And bam, power outage. No idea how long power will be out. It's a sign that eu sucks.
@SirBubbleGum123 No BOA, no RAF, no XP pots. No buying lvl 100, yea, 3 days. ez. There's already proof of ppl doing it. Just saying.
@SdotLow PvE - U farm PvP gear, cause its better than LFR gear, then get a guild, do ur 1 raid a week in normal HFC. PvP - Terrible.
"Pristine Realms"- get to max lvl in 2-3 days, instead of 1, and deal with the same end-game horse shit. KEK
Just woke up, went to bed @ 6 PM last night cause of all the drama going on. Gonna start working on the vid @Grummz sent me now.
@Quorraa we need a safe house from these mother fkers.
Yea fuck streaming today, bitches getting banned left and right and idc to get involved. At least some people rely on drama tho. #content
@summit1g @NickPolom @NZXT @timthetatman I'd say a 20 min drive
@googlefiber could I have a contractor run a fiber optic cable to my house and then have google fiber enabled? Is that possible?
@Sodapoppintv gotta get my 5960 processor up there. Most VR games I can't even stream cause it takes up too much CPU
No stream today. I'm gonna set up above the garage a bit more so I can stream at a higher quality etc for VR games. :)
@WillSuche @FloatsYourBoch I never got those numbers. wtf.
Follow my brothers Twitter @BJP_Official he plans on starting up a stream pretty soon ;)
@_h0neycomb @Frank_Pearce @WowKungen @Grummz no surprise.
@Boogeyman31_ I can't wait to checkout more this Saturday probably. Maybe Sunday
Audio and Mic issues, working on fixing then ill be live.
@Sodapoppintv I can also use anything that plugs into aux port.
@Sodapoppintv I need the best mic quality. What do u all prefer listening to.
@ChaseHuber @htcvive gonna have stream recommend them tmrw
@BaconDonutTV @htcvive it's incredible... And there's so many games for it on steam now
@NickPolom Wow, thanks Nick, so nice of u to do this!
@NickPolom: Follow my boy @Sodapoppintv, wow hes such an amazing guy, he would never do this tweet himself when i leave my twitter logge
@htcvive yea I felt bad for not including them in the tweet. Was just too excited
Ok tomorrow's stream is going to be fucking sick. This @htcvive is fucking incredible
Gonna be live in a sec. Im gathering a list of the streamers etc to send to @Grummz
Yo follow my homie @nickpolom on twitter hes the homie
Some family issues came up guys I can't stream today :/ sorry, family comes first for me.
@Nobbel87 Sincere apologies for what I said about making viewers spam, I probably said that in a moment where I was just trying to be funny.
@Minpojke @Prettydecentman @joefernandes123 Done :D
About the list, i forgot to mention, the streamers support BLIZZARD OFFICIAL LEGACY SERVERS. Completely my bad =/.
@Merex760 Id be happy if they just deleted them, simple as that. They can do it any fancy way they want with gold and shit as long as they go
@gragaslord Im asking everyone I can, but i cant reachout to everyone. Thats why i tweeted asking for people to reach out to me.
@TheTeawrex haha thats awesome man hopefully ull get to try it someday.
@TheQuadler @SwiftyiRL I asked him. No response yet.
@LaMaquina_7 I asked him a few hrs ago, just finished streaming so he prob hasnt had a chance to respond yet.
@SmellyDanielle1 @cantlevelup @sxyhxy @Grummz 13k is a fuckton when there was NO promotion involved.
@Kripparrian Would you stream vanilla WoW if blizzard had their own servers for it and u were allowed to?
@SmellyDanielle1 @sxyhxy @Grummz Thats why Nost consistently had 13,000 people logged on at once everyday for a year.
@BaconDonutTV @Blizzard_Ent More like a community driven RIOT. LOL. but yea man I feel you. Thanks for the :)
@Kniveus @Grummz Yes, also ask ur dad, cousins, nephews, idc, everyone.
@ElliottVenczel @malenatudi And that's just one of the problems, oh boy does the list go on.
@Sdigitalgg @hotted89 @alexringe You guys were gods back then, and noobs looked up to u, which influenced them to get as good.
@Grummz @Merex760 I'll DM them on twitter and tell them to follow you back and you can DM them from there. They've been responsive.
@Grummz @Merex760 To a new player however, if you dont have full BoA gear, no one wants to lvl with u cause ur dmg is so bad.
@Grummz @Merex760 The level cap is currently 100, if you have full BoA gear, and xp +300% potions, u get to 100 in half a day.
@Grummz @Merex760 Well at the moment, everyone has killed the last boss, and no new content is planned for 4 months.
@Grummz There's a lot of other things that were left out in the video, but yea, the core components of WoW are gone. It's just really sad.
@hotted89 There was a reason to improve, and something to be proud of that u had and others desired when u achieved it.
@Grummz Just wanted to say after reading some of your responses to people. Ty for being so open and real about this. It means a lot to me.
@TDrejhede LOLLLLLLL. Don't even need to tell you why ur stupid.
I just got rilly hapy win I thot of how far Ive cum, nd how so many ppl hav supported me, nd I just wanted 2 let u guys know i stil h8 u all
@bodil40 I'm so fucking annoyed with obs studio or whatever. It goes live randomly. It's so annoying
@ChuckDewland Yo dude, Congratz, that's a huge step and u will b happy.
@Kraftvaffel @rakuenCallisto AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAA . Loser.
Literally 3 pages of the new game releases on steam are VR. :( SSS requests is so difficult atm.
@Rudepick well, I did my part that's for sure but that's kind of absurd to think I have that much power and that its all my fault...
@Supatease my garrison, cause it seems I can do everything the game has to offer from there.
@NostalBegins do u guys sell shirts? I'd like to wear one to Blizzcon.

@kleeborb3 It does, wish I could level normally though, kindof impossible since I get swarmed by both horde/alli.
Of course there's an internet outage the day I want to come back.
Not streaming today again. Gonna go outside and do stuff then play vanilla wow again.
So. I stayed up all night playing vanilla wow. No stream today -__-. I'm gonna keep playing.
Walking around World of Warcraft without a mount makes you appreciate the whole world so much more.
@LandfallGames Any possibility to be able to stream Cluster Truck tomorrow? Let me know in DMs :)
Can't stream for a while. I got a guy drilling holes in my walls and shit for security. But I'll be live In an hr maybe
@htcvive hey, would it be possible to use your product on my stream? :)
Hi guys. What's going on in your life? How was your day? :)
@just_josh_okay true, but I didn't even reach that goal, and I knew I wouldn't. I just knew that hope, is what drives ppl insane.
@Sodapoppintv all of you replying to this tweet are sellouts. Probably paid to call me a sellout by some other sellout fucker.
I love how the definition of sellout nowadays is that if you make $, you are a sellout. That's it. LOL, I love the Internet.
@pythCS: Won a $25 Steam Game subbing to @Sodapoppintv worth it, PogChamp
My friends are coming over in a bit so after that I'll stream, I'll be live in 30 min.
Shoutout to my boy @NickPolom for reaching 1000 subs, he deserves it, Follow his twitter.

The main stuff in my house is almost done. I promise to be back into daily streams soon. MAYBE, today, or tmrw
@Sodapoppintv I texted my mom this picture to see what she thought and she was just as racist as u guys :(.
@taymoo7 there's an outhouse with screens all around. And a doggy door. I wanna get some cheapish outdoor furniture for it .

Ima be a bit late. I got to sign some papers and shit.
@Something_ign @ByronBernstein not in Texas otherwise we'd hangout. SOOOOON
@pcgamur1 the way I see it. I can date anyone. In your mind and others they're gonna be a leech. Convos with people like you are pointless.
@pcgamur1 everyone is unoriginal at some pt in their life too. Never met you not talked to u before, weird assumptions on your part about me
@pcgamur1 in what way is that leeching? She pays her own rent and her portion of the bills.
@RiotAzael I'm in Austin. Maybe 10 min or so north of byrons place if u know where he is.
So. What if I removed every emote I have. And got a fresh new 40 emotes LOL.

Not streaming today I'm out shopping on Black Friday. Already got stabbed by a sassy black woman cause I bought something she wanted.
I'm so disgustingly distant and unknowing to what my family is up to when I stream everyday all the time. I rly need to change that. :/
Sometimes I forget how good the graphics are in real life.
@Ollee64 Im glad someone finally found a place to put themselves on a pedestal. Here's a cookie &lt;3.
Any other streamers guilty of pretending someone in ur chat said something about a subject cause u feel like talking about it?
I'm gettin real tired of all these blizzard betas fucking with me.
I'm on my way home right now in an uber I'll be home in an hr or so
Back in Cali from Texas looking at houses. I think I did a solid job tweeting updates etc while I was out there in Austin.

Hope no one hates me for saying this but at this moment I am NOT in the mood to stream fallout 4 LOL.
Apologies. A rumor spread around that cosplay winners won more than wow Blizzcon champs, and I believed it. Thank god it isn't true.

So many awesome friends from wow keep coming 2 me and Im not as welcoming 2 them as Id wana b at 1st cuz I only know there name/voice :(
The download is rly bad at this event. So I gotta let stuff download and try streaming tomorrow.
God ferals fking suck when they go against an RMD that can play. Nothing u can do :(.

@ChuckDewland lot of Cdew shirts I'm seeing. People are giving you love. Wish u were here.
@DanielVanDuzer: @Sodapoppintv tomorws paper reads "Internet celebrity Chunce Morris has reportedly died of thirst after his vending mac
Cant believe we reserved rooms at @Marriott MONTHS ago and they said they had no rooms available when we got here. Now we're screwed.
@LegendaryLeaTV: What's the point of reserving a room three months in advance and you guys don't have a room for me @Marriott
Went shopping for clothes cause all my clothes were dirty and I wanted to smell good for ppl. Idk how to do laundry. Omw to Blizzcon now.
Power in nicks room went out which is where the router is. RIP. I'll be live tmrw.
Went into a public bathroom. Shit my pants cause it smelled so bad... But at least I made it to the bathroom.
Need a break from just constantly being insulted by my chat today. Sorry to everyone else.
So I'm hosting Twitch.tvBobross, and when i unhost to go live, my chat riots, and tells me to leave. So i left and re-hosted Bobross.

@kaceytron @ByronBernstein @holinka give her a key or sexist.
Finally got a Capt card working and capture my PS4, after breaking 2. Phew do i have some venting to do on stream. Ill be live in 20 min.
One of my splitters broke 2 monitors and 2 60 fps capt cards before we found out it was doing that. Fuck.
Now a 2nd monitor popped and it sounds like air is leaking out... What the fuck is going on.
@LordMango_ first I should unplug my router and count to 10 then plug it back in.
@iamvhell @Zlinnt LOL. This convo is so ridiculous to someone who hasn't played guild wars 2.
I really wish i played @GuildWars2 when it first came out, im so scared to get into it and suck while everyone else knows what theyre doing.
@Pancakeflippers too late in the stream to start another game and the entire chat would just be asking why I'm not playing dishonored
@Sodapoppintv it's a great game it's just one of those games u rly gotta take ur time with. Kindof not enjoyable while I'm streaming
Apparently I am not streaming today. Going truck shopping with @LegendaryLeaTV and @NickPolom
Woke up 15 min ago. Showered. Now ill stream in 10 min. Sorry for oversleeping. Last day of @bladeandsoul today.
@summit1g Incredible combat. Addicting MMO u just wanna keep playing. Tweet @omeed and he can hook u up with a key if u wanna stream it.
@CLG_HotshotGG it's great. No idea how the endgame is and just like any mmo in a bit overwhelmed with all the diff content. But combat is A+
Twitch chat. is FUCKED atm. LOL. Rip all BTTV emotes/gifs, now i see how stupid chat looks to people without it.
@BetterTTV: The BetterTTV cdn and api are currently down, you may experience some issues. ^TPC

@VermintideGame I've done like 4 runs on normal/hard and my game crashes at the very end and i get no loot or anything :(
@Sodapoppintv lol I wasn't giving other streamers shit. I do the same thing. I was just pting out how many streamers I follow. Jesus people.
Don't think im streaming today. Maid is coming, and I have to workout paypal stuff and IRL stuff.
Just saw the movie sicario. All I can say is... Holy shit...
I'm kinda tired of my entire Twitter feed being "live now" and "thx for watching my stream". Lol, That's all it is nowadays. -__-.
   PANTS ARE DOWN, SODA'S LATE, GONNA MASTURBATE WHILE I WAIT

@Elyshot I snuck a lot of dank memes in my carry on that plebs gave me at twitchcon. I've been reborn.
@itmeJP my nose is stuffy. I think a streamer came sick and doomed us all. We must discover who it was and expose them.
nnnnnnnnnnnn

@Swoop3y: @Sodapoppintv PANTS ARE DOWN, DICK IS FLOPPIN, I MISS MY FLIGHTS IM SODAPOPPIN 
@CryWasTaken true, budget issues I guess :(. I wish it did better in sales so there could be an Asuras wrath 2. The dlc ending makes me cry.

@Anklespankin I'm good man lol I recovered finally. I'll see u around
@ArchonAmazHS omg I love u plz meet me at twitchcon.
Tmrw for H1Z1invitational I'm not gonna play safe like everyone else. I'm landing in PV and I'm going down in flames and taking ppl with me.

For some reason all flights are booked until Sunday. Me and lea might have to drive but we're too lazy so might not go now. @LegendaryLeaTV
Missed flight. Next flight is booked so they put us on standby for it. Let's hope 2 ppl don't show up for their seats.
Thought the flight leaves at 1:50. Turns out it ARRIVES at 1:50. Fuck us sideways @LegendaryLeaTV let's hope we make it.
No stream today guys, Im up and feel "alright" but i dont wanna do too much and make myself feel bad at twitchcon. Sorry guys :(.
No stream today. Just woke up and as I predicted I'm too sick :(. Throat hurts. Bad head. Can't breath outta nose
That wasn't so bad. Stroheimer really got me worked up. Bastard.
On my way home in a sec and I can do a late stream :)
Regarding money stolen from me, I have all the proof I need to press charges. I'll get more into detail once police stuff is FULLY handled.
(   ). *   are down, but I hate waiting, so I started masturbating (   ). *  
Stopped to get gas in LA. When a police helicopter started circling us. Injured suspects wanted for a shooting were in our area. We left.
@chimpoelolz LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
The population of Page (the city I'm in at the moment) is 4500. My stream intro gets more viewers. Kindof a mind fuck for me.
30 min away from lake after 6 hrs of traveling. The roads flooded. 4Head
@Sodapoppintv some people just bring shame to the job title of "streamer" that I myself and a lot of others are very proud of.
LOL. There's so many ppl who stream and "love" their "job" as a streamer and do barely 3 hrs streaming a day. Barely even 5 days a week. Pls
@DillyTheHunter You're so awkward but i love you.
 PANTS ARE DOWN, DICK IS FLOPPIN, WHERE THE FUCK IS SODAPOPPIN 
What are some of the best games I've played on Shit Show Saturday, i wanna see what people think.
@kmonkeyblog Hey, I'm a streamer on twitch and want to discuss streaming your game if you could follow me back for DM's.
@NRG_Solara I got a 4 day vacation coming up at a lake with leas family so I'm streaming everyday to "earn" those days off.
@Sodapoppintv as much as I'd like to delay my stream, I can't. Too many ppl expect a 24 hr stream THIS Saturday. Can't let them down.
I'm noticing NA regionals for WoW are being played 1 hr (drive) from my house from the beginning of my 24 hr stream, to the end. Dang it :(
@TheyCallMePansy lmk how many bugattis u see in that place.
@Clutter_GCD @Tempo_Storm @TempoElit3 @Jahmilli_TS @StarshipWoW @Tempo_Pikaboo my god.
@LudwigSamuel U have my permission to use the sodaMOD emote.

I wish I could favorite someone's favorite on Twitter.
@BirdyLovesIt @Sordiway123 lol if he impresses me win another one. Maybe, I have so many mods.
@underflowR @Kripparrian truth is I'm mad that I don't have friends :(
I have 7 available emote slots. If u wanna actually take the time to make some, i might send em in if they dont suck. God help me.
Totally awesome super unique stream today guys. I love all u guys so much. I'll remind u how much I love u in tmrws tweet as well.nnsodaL
Asura's Wrath is an incredible game. Basically back to back epic boss fights and cutscenes. Unbelievably underrated. I recommend it.
@cbelz_ People recommended I get like Chocola/Vanilla (one on each side) bouncing for each donation, simple yet nice.
So, I want a new donation box or whatever, and I want to upgrade to a transparent GIF to be professional like everyone else. Ideas?
I'll be live in a bit. My main monitor broke so swapping it out but have to find the right cables since this shit doesnt take display port.

@Neony_Dota @Twitch @TwitchSupport @FEMINATlON I see nothing but professional gameplay. But maybe u could take it to Judge Judy.

@MillerrrTV @POTATOKINGG @solid2q I actually am mind blown with how big of a white knight you are. Nothing I say to you will change ur mind.
@nyctophobian shit I wouldn't mind too much. I only get insulted cause they walk around with the same title as me which they don't deserve.
@solid2q @MillerrrTV having them, is different from using them.
@MillerrrTV the fact ur gonna even try to compare this artistic masterpiece to showing cleavage to horns virgins is beyond me.
Hey twitch girls. I know ur sexy and all. And u wanna post pics. But take it down a bit. Ur not cam girls are you? If so, admit it at least.
Talked with Andy. Gonna do his bday stream Friday. I don't know if my eye will be better by tmrw so it's safer to do that.
@linquata_jake I guess someone didn't see my eye yesterday
I'm rly sorry guys I can't stream today. My eye is more fuckdd and I gotta let it heal
Internet issues. Again -__- I actually hate everything today. Will be live again in a sec
I fucking scratced my eye while sleeping last night and now i can barely see...
I guess whenever I go live from now on I'll take a pic of my tits for you. That seems to be the thing.
@johnxhavoc turns out there's so much that we had to take them to a laundry place to do it all by the pound LOL
@Valmorian she needs a bed to lay on which is in my room and where I stream but I appreciate ur concern.
If she starts feeling better I might be do a late stream
Leas really not feeling well. Gonna take the day off to do laundry and maybe play vanilla wow while she's sleeping . Poor bb :(
Streaming kinda sucks when u don't have a go to game to play when there's nothing new and interesting that day.
@TwitchSubAlert hey guys. I can't find an option to show resubs but not play a sound. Would be a sick feature &lt;3

@timthetatman @morberplz I wish u were here Tim :(.
@Sodapoppintv lol it's a matter of physically hurting us. Don't throw shit. Don't yell at us when we're trying to stream. Understand that
Just a heads up to people at dreamhack. If you fuck with streamers too much. You will be kicked out. Have fun but have a limit.
Germany has fucked me so hard with flights and customer service. I'm now farting On all ur chairs and around all ur German ppl. Fk u Germany
Because we missed one flight. Every flight we have is canceled. We have to re buy flights to get home.

Dude periscope rapes to film stuff in real life.
@_Lilleman That's the thing, I was telling my chat, "You can't troll me and convince me my stream is offline by spamming DDOS"
When ur streaming a non-online game and it takes u 10 min to realize ur internet isn't even online.

If y'all bitches try some stupid ass April fools joke, I will cut you. No one cares about ur stupid pranks and it's all predictable so don't
@KevinJernbekk not today. Got some errands to run.
@timthetatman already planted c4 charges around the house
He doesn't need to be taken to the vet. He shit out the worms cause he got de-wormed last time he went. This is him getting rid of them.
My dog just shit out 20+ worms out of his ass onto my carpet and their still moving. I took a pic but it's too gross to show.
Leas getting a new dog, I want to make sure Buddy and him get along, groceries, haircut, and cleaning my house. You kids are literally 12.
You dumb children actually need me to tell you everything I'm doing today since I'm not streaming? I'm losing faith in humanity.
No stream tmrw I just realized how much irl shit I have to get done. The real world sucks.
I "attempted" to dye my hair my natural hair color again. And I'm gonna try txt to speech donations tmrw.
@BajheeraWoW: Great evening with @Warcraftjen @Carnasses @towelthetank @seriousgamingtv @Fail_lula @devolore @Dcarterwww @Sodapoppintv @Le
I'm the only guy who laughed rly loud at some of the racist jokes during the movie get hard. Mistakes.
Comp reset but I fixed the problem. My power cord was like barely pushed in. Live in 5 min
Favorite if I'm bad at letting people know I'm not streaming that day.
@waynewilliams13 yea i un musselled him after they got along. Just over cautious. Didn't know what to expect

My internet is down again and idk how I fix it -__- let's hope it's just an outage for tonight
Do you want me to give WoW another try this Sunday?
@blitzcrnk I'm probably full-cam more than she is.... you're being ignorant.
@Fail_lula he's so good. He'd prob be happy to see u sometime again.
Well today was shitty LOL. I hope in the future we streamers can get a heads up and just take a day off to shop for groceries.
Verizonwent offlaine im sty i be back tmrw for stream. &lt;3
@Wickdlol @SivHDtweets I am fucking down dude :D LOL. But I'm drunk after 2 shots. Wickd knows this.
I'm considering a series where every WED I stream LoL and get drunk AF. Debating it.
LOL someone took the time and hacked my LoL acc and deleted everything on it. Just tweeting it so ppl on my friends know it wasnt me. 2funny
If u win 100k in a LoL tourney, you divide the $ between the team, then -50% (taxes) -30%(Obama). Drag the 9. You're actually in debt $5000
Does anyone else follow people speeding on the highway, in hopes that you'll get to speed but they'll get the ticket?
@Danielle_Nichol I have not, but Id love to try it sometime and realize I dont like it.

Im considering playing Guild Wars 2 tomorrow, and attempting it as a new MMO for me. Any tips?
So which PS3 can play all PS2 games? Im baffled that they actually made the newer PS3s UNABLE to play them.
Good stream ladies/gents. Half Life 2 playthrough tmrw. I swear to god if people lied to me and it sucks im gonna be so salty.

@LoLDyrus my friend. There's Barbie. Hannah Montana. Petz rescue. Disney princess. And then scary games. Tmrw is gonna be a roller coaster
That House of Cards, Season 3 Episode 1, R Kelly Intro though.
I've decided to delete my invincible reins and farm it again since I'm so bored.
@Bjergsen: @Sodapoppintv See you in challenger chance...
I'm rly stressing about not having a main game nowadays. I'm not much of an FPS person and I'm looking at hearthstone and LoL. God help me.
No strum tmrw guys sryyyy I'm hanging out with IRL ppl for like the first time ever.
Computer reset again. I'm so fking mad at the moment. Going back live now
Favorite if u only rly check twitter while pooping.
Im deciding to stream for 24 hrs straight, the cliffhanger for GOW 2 was too big so now im doing a playthrough of the 3rd one.
Not enough sleep last night And I'm streaming 12+ hrs today so I'll be like in an hr
Games we played today. Ni No Kuni/Farsky/Trackmania/Tasty Blue/Hot Tin Roof/Muddy Heights/Town of Salem/Cloudbuilt/Edge. Thanks for watching
@Bjergsen @FroggenLoL @Imaqtpielol happy bday u beautiful bastards. &lt;3
I am streaming in 2 hrs. Need to sleep longer to fix my schedule. The order play through today HYPE
Watching 50 shades of gray and I was more embarrassed buying tickets for this than buying my anal pleaser dildo 9000 at the sex store.
@LegendaryLeaTV: This guy over at that desk named @Sodapoppintv thinks he is going to win some of his money back. Sweatpants $500 bets h
Put 500 on red and I hit. Then 200 on black and I hit. Luck boys.
A fortune cookie at a restraunt told me to put 500 on red.
@roflstomped10 just got here. Gonna try duck for the first time then it's gambling time.
Not at the casino yet, debating how much money I should spend here though.
Casino time boys. I'll keep updated on how much money I've lost.
Announcement to fellow X-WoW streamers, when you aren't playing WoW, you should not be in the WoW section. LOL.
@KryozGaming not as good as the first. Killing ppl in the 1st game felt rewarding and awesome. In the second one it's boring/unrewarding
@StarEater_ @koalibears @Hironalol @taymoo7 @MissAlice_94 @LegendaryLeaTV god dammit .
Shit Show Saturday #73 games that I played 2day. Ikea simulator/Sims 4/Monstrum/Tokyo School Life/Grow Home/Jet Car Stunts/Lucius 2/
Shit Show Saturday #73, subs recommend games for me to play. Happy Valentines Day everyone &lt;3
Headache is gone and I'm up I'll start streaming soon. Despite being late
Slept for like 12 hrs and have a massive headache :(((
Going to start my stream 2 hrs earlier from now on maybe. Im so tired of finishing my stream and then even grocery stores are closed LOL.
My obs and subtlert completely reset on me and I don't have half the stuff I need to fix them. I'm trying a system restore and I'll go live
Looks like my gtx 980 doesn't work with avemedia capt card. Time to downgrade
Really enjoying the survival games lately. Might try Altis Life if I can ever figure out the fking controls.
@Arclegger Hey my account is suspended I'm not sure why...mind taking a look @ it for me? ChunceMorris123
I signed up for twitches most muscular viewer base. Please send pictures of yourself flexing. May be retweeted.
I actually think I'm quitting WoW for now....really annoyed with how boring it is. Might come back to it when it's fun again.
@shofu Ey I'm trying to get hold of a streamer called Gawdbooty do you know them?
@visecs what are you yelling about quieten down over thrrr
@ShannonZKiller I'm just... I'm so disappointed in you
@FSnowzombie Maybe I could get you to draw a mega cute Rye sometime :D
@FSnowzombie Rakka is literally how I envision Rye without the face markings. Great minds
@Jeff_like_Feff @ForHonorGame Completely agree and even if the stats aren't spot on here the concept is exactly what the game needs
@TehJamJar: Tonight.nnHey streamer, it's *old name* here. I'm now *new name*.nHey, it's me *old name*.nDon't you remember me?nStreamer?
@WishfuiiyTV @JonsandmanTv @TheNo1Alex not gonna lie we were both so frightened I couldn't tell you which one of us it was
@crendor @JonsandmanTv @TheNo1Alex my skills are dusty why you gotta come for me like this
Having a night out with @JonsandmanTv and @TheNo1Alex and none of us have social skills this is going to be an adventure
Major props to @PhillyD for staying neutral in the controversial topics he covers unlike all those hungry fear mongering media outlets
@DreadedCone @Peeverson Hahaha watched him last night just in LOVE with his little wicker hat
@SirScoots @GoldenboyFTW Far too buggy of a game to be an esport. It's setting a bad precedent
I had intended on going live over an hour ago but I've been trying to get into the GR:Wildlands servers for well over an hour now.... Nice.
@shortyyguy You can actually get onto the servers? Makes one of us!
Guess it doesn't help everyone I know pre-ordered 3-5 Switch consoles each so there's none left for the rest of us 
@shoe0nhead: why dont you like pineapple on pizza
l gave you a supportive tweet earlier but now I take it back. I'll burn your little weeb ship like the rest of 'em @Peeverson
@Peeverson I just reached max gear score with a Kensei, I'm half samurai at this point haha
@RubberNinja: Just a reminder: #Animonthly is on the 27th! Optional theme is "dance". Will browse hashtag for work to RT!
@GennaBain @Totalbiscuit 
@ShannonZKiller @GeersArt If she liked pinapple on pizza she'd be a real princess instead of a pretender.
@CohhCarnage Ahhh I was referring to the 'fruit on pizza is wrong' comments cohh!! Lower your spear!!
I can't believe how much pineapple on pizza divides humanity it's hilarious. Best part is people don't realise ALL pizza has fruit (tomato)
@ForceStrategy ah my snowy fur hat avatar brother, glad you stand with us
@summit1g welp no more of those for me I wanna live fam 
@goonisaur I just turn into a bitch but it's out of love omg the struggle
Finding myself so invested in For Honor that I get salty really easily. Gonna try and curb that and enjoy it more. Thanks for tuning in!
Day off today guys, going for a fancy shmancy dinner with doogs. See you all tomorrow!
@itmeJP literal normal day for me JP you must do better
@FairlightEx you've fallen so far from Odins favor... so so far
Was only a matter of time before I started running into Shugoki players abusing the double hit / unparryable bug. What fuckin' nerds.
The guy asked me if I was vegan I thought he was taking the piss only now do I realise I ordered a vegetarian thing fml
Apparently Falafel is NOT the American version of a Doner kebab I have made a terrible mistake for dinner.nnStreaming For Honor soon
@RollPlay: today marks the 4th year of@RollPlay - thanks everyone for all the support and to all the cast members who have been on ove
Our generation are like dysfunctional siblings, we fight with each other and cause drama, but old institutions start shit we'll all rally
Old media outlets trying to attack our New Media Prince @pewdiepie don't realise that our army is vast. Our shitposts will blot out the sun
Ill be back in a few hours streaming some Bloodbowl II / For Honor!
@wendijay Hi Mrs. Jay. I really think you should let her have the cat.
Sorry guys PC blue-screened and now I can't go live on @Twitch - days going good so far.
Got my @ForHonorGame collectors edition in the post today - I'll unbox it later on stream
.@SkyWilliams @TKbreezy On what planet do you think your Dr. Erode lookin ass is 'King of the West coast' at Powerstone?? Best take a seat
@Judaius Either way the result will be the same ;)
@shmegegge @Fugiman nGlitches are purplenThe true kappa is goldnMemes ARE funnynYou're just way too old
@SilentDo0m Mine's a little worse than yours and was a natural 5*, guess that means natural 5's don't mean shit either LOL
@VeteranHarry I've always got your back harry we been bros for years ok never fret I'll make sure you get that dress you wanted
@VeteranHarry: So @PyrionFlax is away on our Valentines stream. 100 Retweets and I dress as a grill so all you lonely kids can have a da
Driving to work I let out the longest loudest Vader inspired "Nooooooo" as I realise I've left my lunch at home. @dexbonus is horrified
@DevTwoThousand I'm gonna be the swaggest Shugoki on the block
I have no idea how the @ForHonorGame War of the Faction scores are calculated but if both weekends are combined Vikings won. Proud of us all
@Sips_ my supper, my socks, pictures where I pretend I'm asleep but somehow still taking a photo, duckface
@scourgeoe @BloodBowl_Game @crendor @MrLichreaver Ouch
@gmart711 enjoy being alone with that monstrosity of an emote
@ForHonorGame: Only one hour left to play the Open Beta. Play for free now to help your side win the War of the Factions! #ForHonor
Apparently today's beta ends in 20 mins? I thought it was 5 PST 
A handful of content creators have been given the game a day early with permission to stream it for those asking.
Tomorrow I'll be doing a 24 hour stream to celebrate the launch of @ForHonorGame starting at noon PST!
@summit1g gonna just stay at home and steal viewers 
@Squatingyeti @itmeJP we are polar opposites haha JP hates it and I love it
Vikings, you are losing to those weeb fuck samurai. We dishonor the gods. Take up your swords and win that damnFor Honor faction war!
@HoustonxProblem that makes sense. Regardless the dunk is disgusting
@HoustonxProblem ah is that the technicality? I always thought it was the bounce.
@HoustonxProblem It's pretty hard to tell I've watched it like 20 times and I'm counting 3 steps after the bounce?
@PokeKellz You look like a high ranking member of Team Rocket
I literally don't understand why @Twitch didn't moderate communities and have people submit one to prevent duplicates. Just seems lazy.
@Timmac_ @aureylian @InTheLittleWood @itmeJP @AnneMunition why mine works fine and double PC set-up has its disadvantages too
@aureylian @InTheLittleWood @itmeJP @AnneMunition sounds too complicated
@kaitly_n It's in my top 3 movies of all time, now the second one might be in there too
@MrMoon1000 man you gotta watch it, it is literally nothing to dislike about the movie, it's perfect.
John Wick 2 was just as good as the first. Holy shit what an incredible movie.
@xD1x @ForHonorGame @LIRIK @GiantWaffle @shortyyguy I can't get enough haha
Fell asleep at 8pm last night and slept for 12 hours  nnThanks for all the support yesterday we hit an all time viewer high
@GiantWaffle @LIRIK @ForHonorGame @shortyyguy Trying to recruit 2 of the world champs I see. I'm down
@Miragenz @Twitch Warlord was already nerfed in the build for the event.
@FairlightEx Oh thank god I'm struggling here. See you later! haha
@FairlightEx Yeah I feel you. We spoke about it yesterday but post-nerf I don't actually think Warlord is that good.
@FairlightEx It sounds like your gripe is actually with Environmental kills and; you're just taking it out on character that excels at them.
@FairlightEx Warlords are weak and don't have any chain attacks, also throw into wall stun into heavy take around 45% of his stamina.
@FairlightEx My suggestion would be to play as Warlord so you can understand its limitations and how to play against it.
@FairlightEx Warlord isn't a great duelist to be honest, and their crowd control is strictly defensive.
@FairlightEx I personally think you are confusing the statement 'broken' with 'environmental kill specialist'
@FairlightEx Had he not countered your grab you would've done the exact same to him though...
Hey guys - gonna play some @BloodBowl_Game today in the new league as I don't wanna start Nioh and then put it down for For Honor tomorrow
Fire Emblem: Heroes players - who's better, Fae or Nowi?nnAlso what do I do with all my 4 and 5* duplicates?? Only 3* can be sent home?
@J1tails Nowi is great, she's melee but can counter ranged units and has good ass def.
@Sodapoppintv not fav'ing it cos you asked but cos I respect the commitment learn the difference ok
Awesome hanging with all the twitch streamers from the For Honor event kicking it with dinner and drinks this evening. Great bunch.
@FairlightEx: Out for dinner with everyone from the @ForHonorGame event.nnI requested the table farthest away from any edges or cliffs.
Thanks for watching guys, I was beyond nervous playing on stage and most of my tech skill went out the window but we managed to win!
@ForHonorGame: Congrats to Team Vikings for winning the War of the Factions! Valhalla!! @Strippin @shortyyguy @Ezekiel_III @MANvsGAME #F
@shortyyguy @Twitch @ForHonorGame I gotta drive into Burbank and grab some eggs and bacon myself before we body everyone
@HSpacman: @Strippin @Twitch @ForHonorGame That's like taking Lebron to a junior league basketball game and calling it fair tho...
On my way to the @Twitch War of the Factions @ForHonorGame event to bring it home for the Vikings.
@sanshodelaine @RubberNinja I know you say hobbyist but I'd love to pay you for a short animation
@FairlightEx you'll be too busy respawing to do either, you filthy knight.
@Lewpac22 @BloodBowl_Game @crendorBloodbowl Badman LOL 
The new Bloodbowl II league will be starting with @crendor right after the Super Bowl. You better get a bigger bowl.
@ForceStrategy @Sinvicta @MathasGames @crendor what's a hacky sack?
Why is that song 'Bad Things' on the radio all the time when it's fucking AWFUL
So many people were shot in this movie then instantly fine. At one point I think he was shirtless, got shot then said "heh, body armor"
About to see xXx, ready for Vin Diesel to impregnate me through the screen shirtless on a jet ski
Nebula Jazz is cancelled today. I think I'm gonna take the day off and chill, grab some food with bae. See you guys tomorrow!
@IAmSp00n @KobaltDuck @aureylian I was just telling Erin there's ways around it. Twitch have said nothing about it so some take advantage
@aureylian @IAmSp00n nudity is client side, you can turn it off in the options and they'll all be clothed
@LIRIK: Doing some covert ops shit with @strippin and @GiantWaffle in ghost recon. I call sniper.
Good stream today. Conan is an Early Access labor of love. nnSee you guys nice and early at 9am PST for games.
.@shofu Yo being a good friend, you are hot ass. Better yourself. Smh.
@aureylian Red heads make me weak at the knees not gonna lie
@FairlightEx @ForHonorGame I said I want a glorious death, not I want to kill you gloriously ;)
And when I find out who did it I'll behead you LIVE mother fucka. We'll be live around 2pm PDT - see you then! :D
I'm totally okay with raiding but we're all streamers on a streamer server, make it fun for the audience.
We got offline raided on Conan. I don't know why people don't do this shit when we're on to make it fun for all, gotta be pussies. Feelsbad
@LIRIK bro the replies you are getting about being a role model after we just streamed conan for days have me laughing hard over breakfast.
I will straight up ban you if you disrespect them I don't care who you're subbed to. Be respectful.
Hearing lots of Household subscribers are giving @WishfuiiyTV and @DimitrisPhotos abuse over the sub server. Cut that shit out right now.
@ConanExiles Have you guys made any progress on thralls and tier 2 shrines disappearing on server restarts? Losing thralls is a huge issue.
@EllohimeTwitch ironically the monsters are the only thing protecting us! Haha
My back gave out trying to stand up after that 16 hour stream and I just ate shit spectacularly. Oops.
Pretty burnt out from streaming 45 hours this weekend, gonna take the day off, might stream this evening!
For those messaging me about it, I'm not hating on the women's jackets, I bought the tracer one in ladies XXL and can't even get it on 
@KimPKM @SilentDo0m might wreck yours Kim  ill leave it at that
@crendor @PlayOverwatch with a dragon going down one sleeve? Kreygasm
@SilentDo0m I'm bouta move Zelda and Dedede up a few tiers in that chart of you're boy
@PlayOverwatch 76 would be awesome, maybe Genji too?
Yo @PlayOverwatch if you made themed jackets for guys instead of only ladies (tracer, widow) I'm sure most of us would buy them. 
@skinnyghost @TwitchRP yeah we've got a creator server set up!
It's @ConanExiles release day! I'll be streaming it this afternoon 
@ItsLisaLouWho @TigerLilyCos Buying the Mercy one right now. Hot damn.

@RubberNinja beta weekend this weekend, lemme know if you need access 
14 hours of For Honor per day 2 days running I need help
@Sips_ going to feed you pesto until you explode
From your replies it sounds like Pesto obsession is a California thing. Of all the places I picked. RIP
@crendor @ThePlutooo @amazongames dude turns 1 year older and goes full Sith Lord @dexbonus
@therealzef @shofu it's most places in LA I've tried to get a sandwich honestly
@ThePlutooo @amazongames Ah so you're the reason it's sold out when I went to buy it thanks BRO
It's hard living in America when you aren't a fan of pesto. For some reason it's in fucking everything.
Happy birthday to my For Honor comrade @FairlightEx
@SailorYas @WishfuiiyTV afaik it was a last minute decision to push back release to creators. We all have similar correspondence.
@PlayOverwatch a 'Widowed Widow' skin with spider web looking black lace. Maybe Young Amelie or a Masquerade theme with long dress and mask?
@AnneMunition and that skin was a lazy re-color of her default one! 
@LIRIK if you need some big time plays let me know. 
I love For Honor. Hot damn. Thanks for watching guys, we'll play more tomorrow!
@itmeJP @summit1g Yo I'm with Doogs if you wanna make a 4?
@Timmac_ @MrMoon1000 Hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
2 hours 29 minutes until @ForHonorGame I can smell battle already. No I haven't slept.
@shortyyguy @ForHonorGame @dexbonus @EdEMonster @itmeJP @MANvsGAME @Ezekiel_III @CohhCarnage Monsters in that line-up, no others live.
@Latebatman2_0 @simplySylvan @ForHonorGame 2pm GMT
12 hours until the @ForHonorGame beta. My body is ready.
Hey guys no stream today because I'm last minute going to look at a house! Boutta put on my 'British Intellectual' voice. Jolly good.
@TheSecondCore It's not a sponsored tweet the brand deal starts tomorrow :thinking:
My daily struggle with @dexbonus making up words:nn@dexbonus : "my tamasita, it crambled!"nnTranslation: "my belly rumbled".nn
@PeanutButterGmr @TheDaveKlein Huh, whadda you know. Would've never guessed!
Trying to set up a compresser for the stream and I have literally no fucking idea what I'm doing. E X P O S E D
@PeanutButterGmr I assumed it might be because your taste in what the best peanut butter is was so bad 
Happy birthday @ThePlutooo you flame haired rapscallion.
Stream running late because I slept for 1000 years then had to get a time machine back to the present but 2 hours later than I had planned
@FF_XIV_EN @dudettecolette 
Thanks for tuning into the stream today guys! All the Revlo rewards have been sent out. See you tomorrow noon PDT!
@CNSoups But do you solo mobas to a live audience who all think they're better than you, because that's where the brain damage kicks in.
The question is do I stream Dota 2 solo in the middle of the day or will I receive brain damage.
@CryWasTaken @Russ_Money Thanks for the host last night fellas. Kisses
Have a great day everyone, support the ladies in your life. The apocalypse would've already happened without 'em.
@dexbonus HOME SOON BABY ITS JP HE'S MAKING ME PLAY DOTA 2
@FairlightEx @dexbonus My true face has been revealed
@N4rf76 @JKCompletesIt @Ubisoft Seems to be a mobile only issue. I watched it on PC just fine!
@PlayOverwatch I need a Widowgeisha skin 
@liefington @DistractedElf @bluejay_712 @skinnyghost @Dave_The_Human This is so perfect
Looking to stream Conan Exiles at launch? @TwitchRP and @thehouseholdtv have teamed up to make a creator server! DM me for the discord 
@ohnips hit up @Gurkensushi - shes the goat for everything twitch.
@itmeJP I'm trying to go live but I'm cry laughing at my desk. Fuck
@TeamHeir @Heir_Jam oh my god boys. I miss you both. I'll let you know when I'm back!
Very very excited to attend @Genesis_Smash #G4 this week - my first US smash event!

@Eowaril @crendor ...he died mark. He's dead. nn
@CoolidgeHD @Thadrius yeah Thad, I got a new league starting today. Get ready boys
Happy Birthday to @Thadrius such a big milestone he's 15 years old today!
@DevTwoThousand Noctis is voiced by Puri Puri prisoner from One Punch Man, and Gladio is voiced by Junkrat from Overwatch 
@itsDanBull I feel like old simpsons had 2 layers of humor, one young and one very adult. As you got older you discovered the other layer
For those interested in joining us for the first time, the game is currently $12 over on humble bundle. nnIt's gonna be a long, salty day!
Tomorrow @crendor and I will be starting the new 2-week blood bowl II league. Stream starts at noon PDT! nnPraise Nuffle.
@MrMoon1000 You're gonna ruin me. It's all over.
@SquirrelPowa @dexbonus Literally streamed til noon in EU today already...
Moving over to Blood bowl. GTA server is rammed. Come hang out and watch the salt!
@megatobins I LITERALLY streamed until 5am PDT which is Noon EU time last night. I streamed all morning for EU...
@itmeJP I respond to anything related to FFXIV and it just baits out this textbook response from you every time hahaha
@itmeJP Ooo one on the left looks nice might snap that up
Stream soon. Went way too hard and did an all night 13 hour stream after Die-Kea and burnt myself out haha
@TheJoefudge91: Stayed up incredibly late watching @Timmac_ and @Strippin on this. It's possibly the funniest game for RP I've ever come
Maybe the funniest fucking stream I've ever done. Holy shit. GTA V RP is GOLD
@AnneMunition @lolrenaynay I know Anne, I'm 100% on board &lt;3. What I'm not okay with is 'White dudes' being the straw man counter argument.
@AnneMunition @lolrenaynay I'm not disagreeing with any points here, never was.
@lolrenaynay Their issue isn't boobs its individuals monetizing sexuality. You turned that into a generalization then went 'but white dudes'
@lolrenaynay I literally didn't though 
@ashtrology_ I'm not doing anything and I won't debate you that. Just pointing out a Straw man when I see one. 
@AnthonyKongphan YOU NAMED YOURSELF DANNY JONES LOOOOOOL DEAD

@emmablackery aaah I didn't i danced around it and he figured it out and then it was all downhill
Don't have the heart to tell him I'm dead inside and so is my channel
My uber driver asked what I did for a living and then revealed he's an aspiring youtuber and now my journey is 10,000 questions 
I thought construction in my office would be done today but it's not, so I won't be able to stream until they stop hammering my wall.
@ForceStrategy use @Gurkensushi she's my ace in the hole and she accepts PayPal

@Jae_Crimbo @crendor Nah it was just a time between Crendor and my streams so we could play together. One off thing 
@WishfuiiyTV Dudes chest is so inverted it's probably costing him views to be fair
Thanks for that incredible sub train today guys. All hail Big Mac. See ya tomorrow!
@shofu Don't blame yourself bro. They do that often.
@EvolveTom I'll be dead so I don't worry about it #12hrsaday
@FairlightEx @LandoManiac it's gonna be awesome.
@Jack_Septic_Eye I can wear light grey t-shirts with a smug look on my face knowing there'll be no patches 
@Jack_Septic_Eye I'm the same. Literally never sweat. No idea why!
Doogs let me sleep in before realising I'm Snorlax and will sleep forever so stream will be in like an hour (my bad) - see you then!
@SkyWilliams @stillgray If you had called a guy a dick no one would kick off. You weren't mysogynistic, you got hit with a double standard.
@itmeJP @Faucius both dope films. Saw magnificent 7 last week
@RubberNinja dude I'd love that. Would help me find awesome animators to commission!
Any fun co-op games you'd like to see me and the boys play?

@DevTwoThousand think I'm gonna pick up the fat samurai. I was born to be a fat club wielding samurai
Thinking back there's been so many great games this year. Not sure how next year will come close nnThen I remember its @ForHonorGame soon 
@the_Sage_BB in my experience making a new team and watching it grow is half the fun
@the_Sage_BB because everyone starts on a level playing field and has more fun.
Today Crendor and I will start a brand new Bloodbowl II league. I will show no mercy. I will roll like Mick Jagger.
@RubberNinja not you too Ross... not you too

@SkyWilliams: @Strippin hi there channel 9 news is it true you at one point in time wanted to date sky williams over ur current lover???
Whether you celebrate Christmas or not have a great holiday weekend. nnI'd say 'don't do anything I wouldn't' but I have no standards at all
@SquirrelPowa: Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from all of us over at @Strippin's mod team! Don't forget to resub to him yea
@paradoxiq @Shardbound it's a date. Have a fantastic Christmas bud. 
@paradoxiq @Shardbound I chuckled at the opening statement.
@stephteng hahaha looks like the majority are with you! Saved!
@Squatingyeti @aureylian Oh man. My heart goes out to you bro.
Everyone complaining about steam not working and I'm sat here like 'it's fine I'm hot enough already' 
@dexbonus: Make sure you follow @Strippin he is truly a man of the people. He's also handsome, poweful, talented. Man what a guy. What a
@drazx2 @xsplit I have exactly the same issue draz
@skinnyghost @Twitch it's the hope you had for victory that gets me. So much hope
@skinnyghost @Twitch from where I'm sitting it's the best kind of best hahaha
@JesseCox @MathasGames @dexbonus Mandela effect real as fuck
Talking to @dexbonus about the Sinbadgenie movie from the 90's that never existed. Her eyes widen. "But I also saw that movie"nnRIP
Everyone is going nuts for this Friday the 13th game and I've been murdering kids for 10 years in a hockey mask so it's just old news for me
@SkyWilliams @PhillyD wait Dunkey beat you at smash!?
@OpTicDi3seL I don't even know how you always find out about this shit
@gmart711 Crendor is basically Lucio he'll never get nerfed
I'm the probably the best Bloodbowl player in the world so...
@itshafu it's just the male version of making cleavage with your arm, which is 80% of girl selfies.
Just landed in England and all I can think about is a full English breakkie
@kristenhazard the show is too powerful it's taken most people I love and consumed them
@kaitly_n they are always Saiyan. What are you saying. You need to leave
Seriously really exited to fly home for Christmas. Missed my fam nnWill still be streaming (as will @dexbonus) 
.@dexbonus @toasterwoman @kristenhazard you wonder why Jesse, Crendor and I keep you around. You'd be a month of meals in the apocalypse.
@JesseCox: @Strippin @dexbonus The man speaks truths. Short people look delicious.
Look I love short people (re: @dexbonus) I'm just saying show us big peeps some love cause if it was Natural Selection you'd all be eaten.
I don't understand why Airlines let short people snap up the leg room seats on long flights. I get legit mad. Tall folk just sat in pain 
@Peeverson @MANvsGAME Yeah. What I've also started doing is leaving my best fighter in the freezer as a 'recovery expert' for the others.
@Peeverson @MANvsGAME The loss of a fighter can end up setting me back 6 hours and I'm like 'okay, 6 hours of my time is worth 50 cents'
@kristenhazard @notquitefrodo Ey Kristen this guy bothering you?nn*I grip my special white knight pokeball*
@therealzef @Warchamp7 live streaming and re-uploads from events IS public content creation though, so I disagree with the discord theory.
@Warchamp7 @therealzef @xD1x @shofu Ah gotcha 
@therealzef @Warchamp7 @xD1x @shofu more events than ever, entrants than ever, viewers than ever and a circuit next year. You're both crazy.
@Warchamp7 @xD1x @shofu Smash right now has never been further from that problem.
@pokelawls Twitch is like the only company that doesn't support it on the app it blows my mind.
@Matt_Spanner @DSogz @Shukenja I hate to out weeb people with anime avatars but Yaoi can be romantic OR sexual. Doesn't have to be both. 
@SkyWilliams @shoe0nhead Sky I enjoy shoes content don't pollute it
@Hoppitot @dexbonus The stream is sponsored. The tweet is not. ;)
@xChrisperryx @dexbonus @BlizzHeroes it's sponsored yeah. Should be good fun.
When he starts screaming I just fall to pieces hahaha fuck
Dudes trying to put another broadcaster on blast for attention because they didn't thank him for a host fast enough. What the fuck.
.@Protostar_UK @MarkPurdy1337 and I've never heard of either of you, what the fuck does that matter. Force is a great dude.
@PudgeButcher @FairlightEx you're god damn right I am
@PudgeButcher @FairlightEx 'Trash anime' pfft take your trash ass opinion back to trash town son.
For Honor just ended. Let It Die cannot be played, Archeage is down for maintenance. nnLeave me here to die. There's nothing left.
@FairlightEx: When you're just straight up slicing through kids left and right in For Honor but then you run into a really good player.
@AnthonyKongphan @OhNoAva_tK My poor sweet Anthony, what you're thinking of already exists.
We share a PS4 so I'm gonna be a gentlemen and play For Honor instead (   )
@The_T @YogscastSjin we actually raised the same amount the 3 years prior but I was spending most of it on body oil.
@YogscastSjin The first year I don't take part you guys break 2mil. Fuckin' half life 3 confirmed.
@maxmoefoe @Jack_Septic_Eye I can't wank into a glove.

@ThorDG @TheIronDruid @NoeNickyy lots of love bro
@kaitly_n it was a re-post not a post get rekt doctor
When someone posts a video on Twitter and it's so loud you just wanna choke them out.
Sorry about no stream today guys. Burnt out a little doing 13 hours yesterday and then For Honor access fell in my lap. See you tomorrow!
@FairlightEx: Took about a total of 7 minutes before @Strippin made our first enemies ragequit in @ForHonorGame. FeelsGoodMan
@silvershaman777 @Ubisoft @UplayUbisoft Haha I doubt they work weekends
@TwitchFuzzy @rawrsnacks @saikocat I mean when you have size 14/15 feet the toes are also larger than average go figure.
Say I hypothetically locked myself out of my @Ubisoft Uplay account by entering my password wrong 100 times, how long until I can try again?
@DimitrisPhotos @WishfuiiyTV you guys are precious human beings
@FacianeA: Shout-outs to Gary Qian using that @Strippin special Z-Curse Mimi. Hilarious. Incredible. I love @Pokemon
Guy in Pok VGC using Z-Curse mimikyu right now and you all know that was my original idea. Trend setting since 1988

@BiddenhamIntSch @OfficialTbliss wild retweet there Tommy I did not imagine seeing old Biddenham in my feed this morning.
Haha @LETITDIETheGame is so much fun, played a little off stream tonight - will continue with you guys tomorrow. I got my ass BEAT
@charlesththird @Peeverson Wait how do you name your character!?
@JayBrotatoe @Peeverson They do. He's probably totally aware of that and is just a dipshit.
@Peeverson Drop this dudes handle right here right now so I can put him on blast.
@MrMoon1000 @RockstarGames We're gonna start the Biker Gang stuff tomorrow.
@Peeverson @LETITDIETheGame Yes I was there. Watching as you flailed your way through a floor and accidentally doubled back on yourself
Gonna definitely try out @LETITDIETheGame tomorrow, watching @Peeverson got me curious haha
@WadeDMcGinnis @dexbonus Uhh is it the Dark Souls III shirt?
Day fucking 5 of the @ArcheAge servers still being broken has actually put me on tilt so gonna do a late stream tonight after DnD @ 6pm PDT!
Thank you to all of you in the community for letting me do what I love every day. Just saying it this once 'cos I don't like sappy shit.
I just sneezed and it hurt my ribs so bad I ended up on the floor RIP
@HoustonxProblem @shofu My bars are rarely coveted so I hunker down like a hippowdon and weather the sandstorm, get buffeted.
@shofu Cold as ice, that's fine - I'm mamoswine. Looking thicc, I'll make you happy like a Milotic you'll be swoonin' - no trick rooming.

@itmeJP @BikeManStream Living. The. Dream. On. The. Ocean
@itmeJP politics? I'm getting a fishing boat with @BikeManStream and when im not doing pvp I'll be living the dream on the ocean
Thinking of doing a Pok Moon nuzlocke when I'm over in England during Christmas. Could be fun to stream as community.
@Macaluso I feel you on that D.va didn't get any love either.
@ThinkingMemoji Bastion got a Blizzcon 2016 skin, Genji got the HOTS Oni skin. Both very recent.
Heroes who got Halloween AND Christmas skins: Reaper, Pharah, Roadhog, Zenyatta. nnMy girl Widow just sat out here in the cold (literally)
@leilaidrissova @kristenhazard I swear to god if they don't
@leilaidrissova @TigerLilyCos When the Cox goes in for the smooch you'll be weak at the knees
NOT GONNA LIE THOUGH I ALREADY OWN EVERY SINGLE NEW CHRISTMAS ITEM IN THIS MORNINGS @PlayOverwatch PATCH
Ignoring the Summer games recolour, the last time Widowmaker actually got a skin was back in May, 7 months ago?
One day Widowmaker will get a new skin in @PlayOverwatch :'(
@Jessimi @WishfuiiyTV @thehouseholdtv @MrMoon1000 @Thadrius @SelvekTV @timmac no it won't where me and dimitri
@WanabeBrowncoat @itmeJP @ForHonorGame @FairlightEx hell yeah I do
Positive @ForHonorGame team are so worried I'd crush everyone (including @FairlightEx) they didn't invite me to the next play test _()_/
Stayed logged in on Arche Age all night, woke up to stream, I'm still logged in so I don't have to queue for 4 hours.nnI am a god.
@StegerGames hahaha, was referring more to journalism but I mean websites are pretty old school now!
@ChHerms @Pie_of_Saffy let me know if it's a project you'd be interested in!
@leilaidrissova 
@Peeverson I believe in you let's discuss over dinner
@leilaidrissova latest episode was fucking A+ ridiculous
Anyone know any freelance animators that can do something like the Drifters anime opening?
@Docgotgame I got in and got hit by a bug that DC'd me at Character Creation. Literally had to re-queue from the back.
@itmeJP They're releasing 2 'fresh start' servers with no P2W stuff on them today. Gonna try it out
Made my @ArcheAge character. Stream about to go live. Game crashes. Can't get back online. Fuck the gods.
@Zac_Zakuza The new server being released today as all the P2W stuff removed. That's why everyone is excited
Morning guys. We're gonna be streaming ArcheAge today when the new server goes live! See ya then.
Bout to order 100 tacos at Taco Bell to comfort eat my unproductive day @Docgotgame @BikeManStream
Someone tweet at me if/when the @ArcheAge Fresh Start server comes up on NA
@itmeJP @aureylian You obviously trying to look like me which isn't a bad thing (   )
@BDO_News What weapon do they get? They look awesome
I didn't realise how important my ribs are until I injured them snowboarding and now my entire life is in ruins.
@SirScoots @AnneMunition Nah. Wasn't enough snow
*I lean back in my chair and take a deep breath*nnYuri on Ice is straight up trash and pales in comparison to Keijo.
@GennaBain I just bought the stagecoach so I can move towns! Which one are you in?
@dexbonus  step back you popcorn burning succubus
OUR HOUSE STILL SMELLS LIKE POPCORN what have you done @dexbonus
Just got home and saw my capture 3DS has arrived. Aw shit 
@djWHEAT wow showed it to @dexbonus and even she won't touch it. Never even seen that happen before
@MathasGames What do you mean Rye will need me I am Rye we are one
I'm mentally scarred and some of my appetite has subsided. nnRemember me how I was.
@united luggage just started arriving. I'm gonna live 
Two older women just started making out and getting handsy not two feet from my face what the fuck is happening in this airport
Flight delayed an hour, whole plane has been waiting for their luggage for 40 minutes. I'm hungry as a motherfucker. Feels @united man.
@MGilbertDesign Uhh I can do any run and powder/ off piste no problem, probably weakest in the park (can only 360)
As a color blind dude who knows Logans video was complete and utter horseshit @h3h3productions new video was fucking hilarious
@RubberNinja @crendor @Twitch @GameGrumps he's foreign watch out
@The_T I'm already on a bunch of lists over here
@The_T One of them is buried in Boston and I saw his grave and it's literally a giant 8 foot stone cock.
@Kleovik @KingBendrick @gmart711 @NineDotsStudio looks awesome!
@skinnyghost I was roped in to film for @Amanda_Defrance I had no part in this
@AnneMunition: Let it be known that my Dand;D character died because @dexbonus tried to befriend every rabid maniac in the dungeon.
@crendor it's dope. The sleigh drivers are out waiters??
@shoe0nhead Oh sweet I made it into the top 10 
Alright let's clarify @aureylian told me to use the shovel after I couldn't find a brush this is 100% a shitty set up by @itmeJP
@kaitly_n @itmeJP reporting you for getting up in my business you can blame the muricans
@JesseCox @itmeJP look you're calling me out like JP and Adam aren't just watching and it was aureylian's idea. The whole group is dumb
@JesseCox @itmeJP I know what I'm doing pal alright I was pulling the snow from the roof down to get the rest
@gmart711 @SuperMrBC welcome home son. Yo the motherland
@ohnips 
@SirScoots @DownstairsErics Well damn alright then!
@SirScoots @DownstairsErics I don't know if this is a set up Scott...
@maxpotter0 @dannyodwyer Then watch Streamers playing it instead of some awful typed review and form your own opinion
Going on a real life vacation with friends, back Friday. nnI know you'll all miss me, be strong.
@gmart711 @dexbonus Dodger actually kicked her legs in anger and yelled 'Candy!? I can't believe it he's in his 20's!'
@gmart711 @dexbonus This is considerably worse than the discovery of WhiteKanye
@andybelford @HimDownstrz I dunno kangaroo barely even flinches he looks like he's gonna throw down with the guy and the guy walks away
@andybelford @HimDownstrz The bit that gets me is his first thought is 'I have to fight this kangaroo' and he goes into a boxer stance 
@therealzef @_StylesX2 Styles couldn't even redeem a grocery store voucher.
@JonsandmanTv One look at his Instagram and I went as far in the opposite direction as I could Jon
Just saw a guy driving in LA with his instagram printed on the back of his Tesla...
Bought all my snowboarding gear for tomorrow and went broke so will be streaming with @FacianeA later - he's teaching me Pok battling!
@therealzef see you need a warming icon that lets you be an asshole cos people then see it and forgive you
@WishfuiiyTV it's a whole other world what the fuck
@SCFighters @LiteralSalt He's saying that her appeal as a character for him is more than just a skimpy outfit. It's actually a compliment. 
@JonsandmanTv @itmeJP oh he will Jon. I'll see to it personally 
@Spamfish Yo lemme know if you wanna play sometime I need some buds to play with
@RogersBase I've seen all I need to see. I will kill in your name.
"Fuck they're tanking, send in the checkered shirt"
@WadeDMcGinnis If it doesn't then you are too young
@JesseCox Dude literally said 'Geralt of Tokyo' in my head which is racist but great minds amirite
NO, NO IT CAN'T BE. WINDJAMMERS. OH SHIIIIIIIIIIT
Absolver looks like something I can sink my teeth into and then find myself locked in an epic battle with @FairlightEx for a week
Oh wow @playdreadnought coming to PS4. That's fucking awesome!
@kristenhazard Ey sit your ass down and cheer politely I can hear you in the crowd god damnit
PSX crowd needs to shut the fuck up. This isn't a stand up comedy gig. Mother fuckers.
Ey yo Raven though (   )
@kristenhazard A white kid just dabbed in the esports trailer...
@TedCoonradt Ted what the fuck there's no-one here and the office is locked up
Ohhh is it because the Amazon tablet series is called 'Fire' if so I get it now.
I saw people promoting it all day but i still have literally no idea what the 'Champions of Fire Invitational' was?
@michelemorrow it's a prime candidate for @ReaperNames 
Tried out the new @TheDivisionGame DLC tonight with @gmart711 - had an incredible 2v2v2 shoot-out at the final extraction. Was sooo hype
Podcast ran a little late so no stream this evening. Thanks for hanging out. See you tomorrow!
@thehouseholdtv: The Household Podcast will be starting shortly with @SelvekTV @Thadrius @Timmac_ @Strippin @DimitrisPhotos
Why would the default resolution of @Steep_Game be 3840x2160 what kind of sick joke is this
Booted up @Steep_Game and can only see 1/3rd of my screen. RIP
@taliana lilipup doesn't become lycanroc, rockruff becomes lycanroc...
Think I'm gonna try out @Steep_Game today on stream - it looks insanely fun.
The wind just blew and @dexbonus turns to me and says "it's so cold my legs are giving out, we're gonna die" nnWe live in California 
I think taking time to do the FFXV side quests helped me grow more attached to the characters and; as a result the story moved me so much more
@Elvinelol 38 or so. Still got a bunch to do but the main storyline was brilliant
Beat the FFXV story 7 hours ago and I'm still thinking about it.
Finished the FFXV Story. Haven't been pulled in by a story like that in as long as I can remember. God damn.nnSwitching over Blood bowl 2!
Anyone really good at Pokemon Battling wanna help me make a team in Sun? I know how to breed and EV train, but got no matchup knowledge. RIP
@Totalbiscuit my veil is tested constantly. I'm holding on for dear life
@JonsandmanTv @IIJERiiCHOII lox is  but capers are 
Put 90 Mimikyu on wonder trade and only got shitty cutiefly and caterpie back and people wonder why I hate humanity so much.
For those who don't play Pok...nnIt was like winning a free PS4 but when it arrived it was actually a bomb and it went off and I died.
Hatched a 6 IV Toxapex in Pok Sun. I excitedly jump over to the nature - it's perfect.nn...Then I see it. The Limber ability. nnRIP
@itmeJP It feels like they've just got a little list of 8 or so people who get it all and they just shun everyone else. It kinda sucks.
@itmeJP I heard the storyline enemies are scaled to your own level?
@itmeJP Did you get a better experience from keeping your level down? I don't wanna be overlevelled for all the good stuff
I just ordered a hot chocolate wearing a Christmas sweater, flip flops and; playing Pokemon.nnPretty sure they thought @dexbonus was my carer
It's been 3 days since @dexbonus burnt popcorn in our home. nnYou can still smell the charred kernel corpses throughout the house. RIP
@pewdiepie hairy minge aside, tibia was my jam as a kid
@BikeManStream I saw that right at the end, thanks bro &lt;3
@dexbonus How does one even burn popcorn I can't
Huge thanks to @kaorimelody @matkishimoto for hanging out on stream! nnGrabbing some food and then we'll start the 24hr FFXV stream.
@Destraudo @Titanfallgame Right!? That helmet looks so cool.
@fezz4450FFXV @Falris So until the patch both consoles are the same? Just deciding which console to stream on as I haven't set my Pro up
@colton_mckim @osto19 @JKCompletesIt its 70 in-game days, so about 30 real time hours
@BravadoReign Yeah if you want a fresh experience I wouldn't recommend watching!
@BinnsyMatt Yes if you give it a Destiny Knot to hold
So what's the benefits of streaming FFXV on a PS Pro over a PS4?nnOr are there none and it literally only benefits 4k TVs and 4k Monitors?
Actually had to shower and put on clothes as Square Enix are coming to the office to stream with me today.
@Gurkensushi @SquirrelPowa @ForceStrategy I suppose I can 'lend' my most valuable art asset to you force. Tina you may assist him
@BravadoReign It's not paid and they should advertise it more imo 
@FacianeA @PokeKellz @YouTube can you HURRY THE FUCK UP!?
@JKCompletesIt: On the real - @Strippin and I will find that boss in FFXV that takes 30+ hours. We will stream it. And we will win. #off
@LucyMaeGames don't get me started on that I feel the same way and I've only just gotten over it
That Westworld episode though nnCannot recommend this show enough if you haven't seen it yet.
Holy shit that was a fun stream, shout out to @visecs for the incredible new song hahaha.
@Taka_Sakagami @shofu Nah, Ghost Z-crystal for Z-Curse. Substitute and Pain Share.
@Norrislegacy @shofu You need bottle caps to hyper train which are really hard to get.
@itmeJP Visiting Dodgers family sleeping on sofa beds n shit. Tues gonna be goooood
If you use my recruit-a-friend code for Atlas Reactor you can try the full-game free for 7 days! 69HMEH2GDK6L2YX6JJKE (It's dope)
Just bred my first 6IV Jolly Mimikyu. We competitive now. Watch out @shofu
@VaatiVidya I've been chaining hardcore and haven't seen a single one yet hahaha you're a lucky boy
@VaatiVidya you already have all of those? I'm so upset
@StolenHail well shit. There anything you want? I'll take it
Someone out there has a 6 IV ditto and they really want a shiny Trumbeak and I think we can reach an agreement. 
@TofuYoshi do you understand how complex what you just said is when I can just trade someone for it
@ThxtsNumberwang I don't even know what the fuck that is
@D_nasty02 I'm sure I can make use of this rainbow faced beauty
After hatching HUNDREDS of Mimikyu eggs for a shiny I decide to take a break. Walked into grass and; a shiny Trumbeak is staring at me.nn?????
Little air hostess noted how tall I was and bumped us up a class on the flight. Now I gotta pay it forward. Gonna wondertrade 400 Mimikyus
@crendor that's a relief I hadn't actually asked you yet.
Bloodbowl II stream all day tomorrow with @crendor ?
@hotted89 pretty sure there are still private servers around for it
@hotted89 dude I played the shit out of that game aaaaah
@MathasGames gonna be honest mine didn't evolve til level 21 POST blowjob
@TylerMorrill @CauldronOfRamen I have them, I'm going for a shiny
@Pokketsays @aureylian fuck OBS that shits whack
@Scruffmcruff you fucking genius that's what it was you saved me
@Sacriel42 @PlayMXM we gotta play when it's out I love the arena stuff
@itmeJP All their precious guns are in the trucks outside JP. In this Diner, I'm the threat.
Booth next to us:nn'That son bitch got too close so I put 22 rounds in that fucker' nn*I slowly remove the upright knife from my burger*
@CauldronOfRamen nah Matsuda method is faster for mimikyu because of its disguise ability, also it needs the egg moves to be legit
@sherlock_hulmes @Bianca_X23 is that the board game? Sweet Jesus
@ryzila360 do they need to know the move when breeding?
Any Pok Sun/Moon experts know what I have to breed with Mimikyu to get Curse as an egg move?
If anyone tried to talk politics at your thanksgiving table shove some turkey in their mouth. Have a good one.
Getting ready for 'trying to compete with British Sunday Roast' day tomorrow. Do not disappoint me America
@ChrisChandalure @FacianeA @JKCompletesIt @Ejektt @dexbonus @JesseCox every time you are having sex close your eyes I'll be there
@ChrisChandalure @FacianeA @JKCompletesIt @Ejektt gonna miss you boo
@dexbonus @JKCompletesIt @btflglitch @Bournekiller @JesseCox @TeamDavis @Octopimp Wow my feelings. Leave out the non American. Ok.
What should I stream from the ol' farm house today. Maybe Overwatch?
@kaitly_n @WishfuiiyTV Don't listen to her. Seasoned 24hr here. 12 pack of Red Bull, Gummy Bears, Sugar, Cakes.
People complaining I don't name my Pok. nnThere has never been a good trainer who named their Pok in the show. Ever. That is you.
You may have noticed the exclusive @FFXVEN sub icons on my stream. I'll be showing off FFXV gameplay with the Square Enix team on Monday!
@ThePlutooo hold up let me move my set up into the barn for you
Gonna do an ol' farmhouse stream a little later I'll let you know when
Woke up in @dexbonus weird Oregon farmhouse and no one is here at all this feels like the opening scenes of an 'Until Dawn' spin off
@GoshDangTravino yeah chaining exists and drastically increases shiny chance.
@gmart711 Alolan Raichu has the perfect typing to just one shot them forever without getting hit so figured I'd try it out
How long does it take to chain a shiny in Pok Sun cos I chained 50 of those Golbat mother fuckers in a row and NADDA
@Primarina87 check out @shofu video on how to get it, took me around 45 minutes
@TheDaveKlein Mount Hokulani, grass on the right hand side as you descend from the bus stop
Just found a wild Ditto and accidentally killed it 
@SilverHawkeHD yeah lmao even my starter was female which apparently is really rare?
@kristenhazard @JesseCox @dexbonus @crendor @leilaidrissova 
@KevinDavidBurke probably swapping owl for alolan vulpix and MIGHT get rid of Lycan for something else
@Diexna didn't realize til you pointed it out. Ya boys a playa
@crendor @toasterwoman I'm actually at the airport which makes this weirder...
@KimPKM @McDareth we're still playing in the free company if you need a community 
@thewillofdc Yo dude! Do you have an email I can reach you at?
The sound on my PC stopped working after last nights stream and its causing all games to crash on start up why is this my life now
Trying to buy a 3DS XL capture kit so my playing of Pok Sun doesn't interfere with my streaming and I can just do them at the same time
New Stream intro made by @visecs is coming soon. Just heard the first draft. nn...chat will never be the same again. 
@itmeJP @FinalFantasy @JesseCox @djWHEAT Oh shit that's tomorrow.
It's a sponsored stream so we're just gonna flood the server with our communities and have fun.
Streaming a free MMO called Twin Saga this afternoon with @WishfuiiyTV and @gmart711 - get it downloaded if you wanna join us!
Sombra literally can't do enough damage to destroy a Torb turret if hes ignoring her and repairing it. Feels good. Overwatch good.
@NikaHarper I was the same. It's not about kids in a school so I was way more 'in'
Now it's time to download Pok Sun and play it all night in bed 
As someone who hasn't actually seen the Harry Potter movies, Magical Beasts was still pretty fantastic. Go see it.
Accepting of the fact I will never be good at Widowmaker it's nothin' but a pipe dream.
Fit new graphics card to try and fix stream issues. Mic and mixer stop working completely. Life's good.
I told @dexbonus I was her daddy and she nearly threw me out the car.
@aureylian @jasonmaestas Plz take your immaturity elsewhere my livelihood is at stake you fiends
@aureylian @jasonmaestas chats saying it's only Overwatch they notice it but it's likely other stuff too
Whilst trying to fix the frame drops I broke my sound card and my stream so brb restarting PC kill me now
@jasonmaestas @PlayOverwatch NO JASON ITS THE TWITCH SERVERS MY VIEWERS ARE HURTING HERE
@AmarielleEU you fucking FAILED just like i fail at Widow
@leilaidrissova @GennaBain Hahaha I'm like 'I wonder how far I can get on the trail' and I'm just going for it whilst levelling my town
@AmarielleEU She scopes in 20% faster, her shot charges to 100% faster, her ult charge was one of the few not nerfed so its stronger.
@leilaidrissova @GennaBain I'm so far along the trail I haven't seen another player in over a week, just AI
@GennaBain would've been way cooler to make a town with friends. We would've killed it
@pokelawls hahaha your profile picture is perfection
@dannyodwyer @Freshershest Sunset Riders 
@DistractedElf the dark side is pretty much exclusive over here
I need Pok Sun and Moon now. NEEEEED it
Playing on @NopixelRP was really fun, hope you guys enjoyed the stream! See ya tomorrow!
@dudettecolette Am I too late to follow this up? haha
@crendor @Pokketsays "I don't know what a joke is and I don't know what content is either" - Crendor 2016
@crendor @Pokketsays "I don't know what a joke is" - Crendor 2016
@TheTrailGame Hey guys! Love the game I'm addicted. I have a sneaking suspicion my town is all AI though? Confirm/Deny?
@raptorscream @Pokketsays don't try and troll me pikachu is orange
@Pokketsays Just get perfect genetics like me then you don't need health insurance.
@ThePlutooo It starts getting REALLY good around episode 45 and ramps up.
@ThePlutooo No dude episode 60? LOL fucking either you start at like 22 for the universal tournament or jump to 47(ish) for Black Goku arc
@therealzef yeah i wanted the name its kinda cool
Hey guys. No stream tonight - gonna spend the evening learning how to do Arma RP so I can play on NoPixel this week!
@kaitly_n @crendor Oh yeah that happened I forgot guess we are equally weird
@kaitly_n @crendor yeah lemme get that shirt you sleep in it's not weird we are friends. nnCanadians are weird
@kaitly_n @crendor well Kaitlyn guess who is an XL and owns three of those shirts that's right this guy
@Octopimp Whatever it is, it's not in this picture. ;)
@SelvekTV: "Selvek why do you live in a world of shadows?" - @Strippin
@alex201002 Nah plug your headset into your computer, and plug your xbox controller into the computer seperately mate!
@leilaidrissova I cant use it cos I'm too ripped but its cool
@aureylian @JesseCox @leilaidrissova Jesse used to mock me for this shit publicly on the regular. Look a you now, you goofy ass smitten man.
@leilaidrissova awww yeah wear it tomorrow we can be twins
People playing The Trail - are there any towns after the first one you encounter? I skipped buying a house and don't know if I fucked up
I started playing 'The Trail' on my phone last night and that game is great. It's chill as fuck. Highly recommend
@summit1g Bro I heard a rumor that you killed an elephant with a single gigantic headbutt
Ey Americans, no matter what the outcome and no matter how pissed off you are just make sure you don't let that manifest in violence.
@PdxInteractive Hi guys! Would love to show off Tyranny on-stream. Do you do press copies? Thanks!
Apparently Trump is winning right now welp gotta make sure I'm asleep when the world ends good luck America.
@kaitly_n @Pokketsays No continent &gt; Americas next presidents continent
@Pokketsays Did you just take a photo of yourself pretending to sleep?
Purple Wedding hit me square in the bollocks losta whole 'lotta subs, remember your prime sub doesn't auto-renew!
@Sips_: congrats to @Strippin for hitting these important milestones on his first day streaming overwatch:n- pan flutesn- racismn- anger
@IIJERiiCHOII @Twitch  bruh I'm realizing my nostalgia chose to forget all the shit like last stand, martyrdom and juggernaut
@COMETHRUGIRL: nice town. would be a shame if.....the boys were back in it
50mb upload, 4k gaming rig, dropping 0 frames. Stream is laggy as fuck. Kill me IRL
@Cobanermani456 @_AngelCortes_ bruh no carbs or sugar = just lettuce!?
Gonna stream at noon (hour and a half from now) - might do Overwatch ranked and be dragged into the solo queue salt mine. We'll see!
@JonsandmanTv so mad that you never call or text 
@JonsandmanTv 100 crates Jon!? You absolute mad man!
I kinda wanna get back into Black Desert Online but playing alone is rough
Trying to convince @dexbonus that if there's a God he made Saturday a day of rest so I can have mcdonalds and not do laundry
The @PlayOverwatch World Cup has been incredible but I can't believe how far behind South Korea the rest of the world is.
@EatMyDiction1 @IIJERiiCHOII you'll wanna see this diction...
Courses included barbecue sauce scallops, beef tartare Po-boy with a marrow sauce and a sweet potatoes marshmallow tarte. Chef was cray.
Just fine dined a 15 course meal with friends and it was out of this world. Stick a fork in me lads, I'm done.
Second Skynet reference of the Opening Ceremony not feeling good about humanities future
Blizzard, a company loved by all. The perfect unsuspecting catalyst for Skynet.
@JesseCox neither is your hit new comedy show get over here
@JesseCox we are saving you seats in the fucking opening ceremony hall 
@JesseCox stop talking to people and move your ass
Opening ceremony doesn't start until 11 right? Gives us time to park in fucking palm desert and fly back on a plane.
Found an eyelash on @dexbonus cheek nMe: make a wish! nDodger: I wish we were fucking parked. nn
My favorite thing about Blizzcon is trying to find parking isn't it just a peaceful zen and quick experience I just love it.
@HappiLeeErin @dexbonus @crendor @gmart711 you guys love antagonists that pop boners over kids noted 
@HappiLeeErin @dexbonus @crendor @gmart711 I stand with Crendor on this the show sucks
Yo @tacobell my missus ordered 12 bean tacos and she got 12 meat tacos what is this amateur hour?
Thanks for tuning in guys. @Titanfallgame campaign was excellent and the multiplayer is extremely fun. See you Sat! (tomorrow is Blizzcon)
@LIRIK It's work at first as they normally have to spend time together to start getting alone, but my cats clean each others butts its A+
@DarkSoulsGame @Peeverson "nothing personnel" sounds like you're about to fire them from a job
@aureylian @itmeJP I swear to god if it's lalafel...
@nutmegnat @Clonehar ....that actually makes tons of sense
This world needs to end and be born anew. Hail Satan.
@SousaWildin @Clonehar I live in America. That's the joke. It's a joke, mate.
Oh my god Twitter is hilarious Baseball talk is straight gobbledygook and it's like I accidentally changed my browser language.
@Hernandez_Danny @Twitch The ability to toggle or add a few minutes delay to the auto host feature would be awesome.
@Hernandez_Danny @Twitch As it stands if I unhost to prep or my stream crashes auto host immediately steps in confusing audience etc
@Hernandez_Danny @Twitch That'd work yeah, I think most people like myself unhost to prep the audience for the stream going live.
yo @Twitch if I type /unhost in my own channel why does it just auto host again 5 seconds later its literally infuriating. :(
Does Pizza have a twitter account cos I need to DM my crush today apparently.
Shaved off my beard for my Halloween costume and half the people at the party didn't recognize me. Today @dexbonus won't stop staring at me
@JesseCox @Sonic_Kurosaki @ZoeviaBlizzard so old, so stuck in his Jesse cox ways

@itstilby @FacianeA @hildewereld @Frazierdeanpy I'm sorry it didn't have to be this way you could've let it go
@FacianeA @itstilby @hildewereld @Frazierdeanpy @JKCompletesIt oh look a snack so bad it needs a fun hipster way to eat it to compete 
@itstilby @Besso0_ @hildewereld @Frazierdeanpy @JKCompletesIt @FacianeA penguin bars have penguin themed jokes written on the back. They win
@hildewereld @itstilby @Frazierdeanpy @JKCompletesIt @FacianeA omg thank you. It was literally a poor mans Penguin Bar
Children of the Strippclub, I will be on the co-optional podcast today and will be live after at 3PST, you dirty dancing babies
Hope you have a great Easter today. Eat all the chocolate eggs!
@dexbonus: *girl walks in front of us wearing a top with small frayed holes in it*nSam: who the fuck is this girl? Luke Cage?n @Strippin
@DuncanKneeDeep @shofu @visecs Crunchy Nut Cornflakes are top tier I agree
@shaddose @shofu Captain Crunch is sitting in low tier
@shofu I think Sugar Puffs is a UK thing though so I'll let that one slide. 
@shofu I respect the Frosted Flakes but you got no Sugar Puffs, no Golden Grahams, no Frosted Wheats. It's amateur hour on that shelf
@shofu your cereal choices are as 'Disney' as your Pok GO rap. Disappointed fam
@TheNo1Alex nah. grey suit. You're a grey suit guy
About to destroy a Katsu Curry and we'll be live this afternoon with more Xenoverse.

@itmeJP that fucking moogle swing is gonna be me and you - your WIFE nnAin't no girlfriends in the world of final fantasy
The feeling of abandonment when your bro replaces his half of the two part bro emote you have together making it look like you can't let go
Bruh watching Dragonball Super and getting a little emosh right now. We'll stream some more Xenoverse at 2PST - see you then!
@BandaiNamcoUS Hey guys, what do we do if we didn't receive our pre-order bonuses with Xenoverse 2?
Pull into coffee drive through with@dexbonus n"1 coffee for you sir, and ma'am here is your pumpkin spiced late"nMy neck angrily turns to her

@sherlock_hulmes @drazx2 @alsmiffy Nah my party is swamped with frontliners so I abandoned the blade-lock dream.
@sherlock_hulmes @drazx2 I just spent 3 hours making a new 5e warlock I don't even know who I am anymore.
@sherlock_hulmes @drazx2 The moral of the story Draz is just fucking get good ok
@sherlock_hulmes @drazx2 I'd say three is more than enough. Can't think of a session where I've walked away remembering more than that.
Haha that hilarious moment when you haven't slept yet because your backs thrown out and hahahahahaha ha ha HAAAAA
@StephenAtHome: Emma Watson wrote a note urging Americans to vote. She didn't spend her childhood fighting a dark lord so we could elect
@kaitly_n yeah lower back. Wasnt sudden, I was completely fine when I woke up and by the end of my stream couldn't walk.
Gonna just try and sleep it off. Probably just a pinched nerve? I ain't no Doc
From this morning to now I have somehow contracted crippling lumbar pain (can't walk)nnI swear to god if this doesn't lead to super powers
@IIJERiiCHOII @C9Mang0 It's like hiring a hitman but hes a blue bird with space boots.
@IIJERiiCHOII @ShannonZKiller I am way less cool though I see all the parties you go to whilst I am at home in my bunny slippers
@IIJERiiCHOII Being broke + being swole = 6 egg whites every meal plus as @ShannonZKiller I am Gaston so
@IIJERiiCHOII I used to eat 72 eggs a week if that counts
@kristenhazard No I'm saying you have my love nnbut I also want a donut
@kristenhazard If you bring me donuts we can girl talk
Thanks I'm switching off twitter fuck you all see you tomorrow for games
Just got home from the airport where do I watch walking dead I must know
I think I'm one of the few people that doesn't have a Halloween pun I can use as a twitter name and I'm not desperate enough to force one
Whenever I'm about to leave England I always buy a couple of Boots meal deals to eat instead of the plane food... One last English sandwich
Shit so much to stream this week. Dark Souls, Xenoverse 2, Civ 6, regular shit - I'm excited.
@fairlightex @GoldGloveTV don't worry Jesse we can reign supreme in For Honor whilst the kids play with shooty guns

@ShannonZKillerBloggy Bloggerson - by god you've done it again
Whenever I fart in front of my family and blame it on @dexbonus she threatens to murder me at this point I'm dancing with death
@SkyWilliams: never thought I'd have to send someone to the shadow realm with bars but @RashadThReactor shoulda never fucked with @IHE_O
@TiernanWaffle @9GAG feels good when they steal my tweet but blur my name.
@ShaeHarrisx yeah he's a friend of mine! 
@JesseCox it's actually both. It was confirmed by Uematsu in an interview.
Get ready for an underwhelming 3 minutes where we all pretend it was the hypest shit ever cos the truth hurts  #NintendoNX
@itmeJP saw the movie last night now I'm hype as fuck
I ordered a pizza last night and got a shitty one I didn't order and I've been filled with hatred for this world ever since.
@crendor: These pro-life people marching and blocking my path to the grocery store are making me pretty anti-life
Got up to 2500 rating in SFV, get 4 4000 rated players back to back, slapped back down to Bronze. Logic.
@ShannonZKiller Its only single player, not about that Vs. CPU life
I have no idea what to stream today. Nothing is taking my fancy. Help
@JesseCox @aureylian @ZoeviaBlizzard @Twitch You have my axe
@shofu you should hit up @Fwiz try and get it all resolved faster
@BaconDonutTV @Tactical_Pinup Nuff love to you both.
@MrMoon1000 @DimitrisPhotos @SelvekTV I just spat out my coffee
@GoldGloveTV Bro I don't know what it is about gears but I started to feel it today streamin ranked and had to switch games.
Meanwhile they verified me  so make sure you add Strippin on Tuber Simulator and watch me slowly build a cash swimming pool
The Tuber Simulator devs took @dexbonus name away from her for, and I quote, 'impersonating Dodger'. Hahaha
@itmeJP @PlayOverwatch None, had 30k currency from previous spending sprees. RIP
@JKCompletesIt @PlayOverwatch I had about 30,000 Overwatch currency saved up before the new patch dropped.
I just acquired every single @PlayOverwatch Halloween item. The completionist in me can rest easy now.
@InTheLittleWood your room looks very similar to @dexbonus haha - adding you (strippin)
@Timmac_ Fucking congrats bro. I'm elated for you.
When I try and sign into my @Xbox One with my Xbox live account it stalls then just boots me back out to the menu. Anyone had this issue?
@KobaltDuck Typically that's accurate, just having a rough day getting set up with stuff.
@jimmywhis @itmeJP Also lets run that back cos your boy is Super Silver now
@jimmywhis @itmeJP I'm literally bodying everyone in this game so I big to differ BRUH
@jimmywhis Gears is a console FPS and if you think otherwise Jimmy you need a fucking spanking
Oh its not out yet? Thank god.nnSidenote if you're playing with KBM you're a filthy communist.
Man there's like 3 people playing GoW 4 multiplayer on PC. Can't even find a match. Was looking forward to that too. Guess I'll move to Xbox
Forgot my xbox live associated email. Now to spend the next 8 hours trying to find it so I can play Gears of War on PC.
@kaitly_n @AnneMunition Ill give you my set up on skypu
No stream today, taking a day off to spend time with @dexbonus - Channel will be auto hosting friends all day for those who enjoy my chat!
@JesseCox we need to talk about it next time I'm in work
Just finished season 2 of Mr. Robot I need season 3 right now they can't do this so many unanswered questions fuuuuuck
I'm slowly accumulating stacks of cash in Tuber simulator so I can just remove all furniture and fill my office with mountains of money.
@ChlosterSays Literally zero recorded cases of these clowns hurting anyone, the only stabbing was a man stabbing a clown to death
@ShannonZKiller Haha shannon I feel like you REALLY hate clowns
The last Clown Scare craze happened in 1981 - it produced some of the best horror films ever it's like you guys don't even want good movies
I don't understand why people are shitting it about these clowns just give em a beat down.
@GoldGloveTV gonna have to pick it up tomorrow 
@GoldGloveTV dude I literally got into YouTube and Twitch after watching your gears videos years ago  glad to see the return

One of the best things about being tall is that you can open doors with your butt when your hands are full

Everyone: "Yo let's keep this party moving to the Hard Rock!"nnMe: "Yes hello room service id like the chicken tenders."
Are people dressing up for the twitch party cos my brain is telling me to wear sweats
@AtomicDevan @BrickyOrchid8 I was straight up 4 inches taller
.@dexbonus and I will be doing a Twitchcon meet/signing at Streamer Alley at 2.30 (in 15 minutes)

@Thadrius: We are still at the @teamrevlo booth signing , come by to enter for the giveaway! We will announce the winner in about 20mins!
@RevellionOP every 100,000 subs on twitch this month gives $100,000 to charity
If you're on the Twitchcon show floor today go check out @Shardbound the games awesome
Twitchcon merch queue is like an hour long the shit I do for @shofu
@InTheLittleWood @TwitchCon I'm also interested in the answer haha
@AnneMunition well @dexbonus is basically a bag of cheezits so ditto
@The_T @Twitch my name is finally paying off Turps I told you this day would come
Just got to my hotel for Twitchcon. I'd ask what people are up to tonight but I'm smart enough to know you're all shitfaced by now
Heading to Twitchcon but all I wanna do is watch season 2 of Mr. Robot
Thanks for hanging out tonight. For those of you coming to Twitchcon, let's have a dope weekend. See ya tomorrow!

@leilaidrissova @JesseCox if InNOut come to England it will be the happiest day of my life
What happened to the good old days when livestreamfails was about people jerking it and doing drugs.nnNow it's just a collection of my vods
@djWHEAT dude why am I on that Reddit every damn day
@GoldGloveTV @VernNotice I just started today, no issues though pretty much the same, communities probably smaller on PC though
I think I'm gonna remake my NBA 2k17 dude to be a 7'3 glass cleaner and end the world with dunks... Open to suggestions though
@dexbonus @itmeJP What? Thats fucking ages away just go blonde for a bit.
What should we play today gang? I'd play Destiny but I feel like you guys aren't into it much. Suggestions?
@CrikMaster: Everyone show some love to our first contestant in I.C.U. history! @Strippin is an amazing friend, contestant, and guinea p
@leilaidrissova girl I didn't even make a career choice until 23. Don't even sweat it
I'm watching Mr Robot I'm losing my god damn mind
I literally moved from the fire into the volcano nowhere is safe for me.
@kristenhazard @CaitlinDelia @leilaidrissova @omfgblondie Right but the point is they are literally shitty people and you drinkin tha juice.
@CaitlinDelia @leilaidrissova @omfgblondie when there's hundreds of millions of dollars to be gained from itpeople will be close. Sellouts
@Octopimp @JesseCox @dexbonus @JKCompletesIt @FacianeA I think you did 80% of the voice acting Octo MVP
I think @Octopimp might be the Mozart of the Kazoo.
@JesseCox: Thank you to @dexbonus @JKCompletesIt @FacianeA @Octopimp @Strippin AND YOU, for joining me on an amazing Mario RPG 20th Anni
@IIJERiiCHOII how is it I have never had a good night in LA and you're having 7 a week fml

@TwitchFuzzy @BikeManStream It's a new program where normal people can mass flag youtube videos.
Might do a chill stream tonight but combating the fabled migraine today. Went a little too hard last few days. Pray 4 me dawg
@DeeJ_BNG Hey DeeJ. Got a contact email I can reach you at?
@dexbonus @gmart711 he's gonna kill them all and I need to see it
Wow pushed up an update when we were 15% from killing the last boss in the raid I can't fucking even.
@TehJamJar @Sacriel42 @MrMcStabby fine I'll be the bad guy Jam is just a Ragnar wannabe
@Sinvicta I need you to teach me how to become strong
Anyone playing Summoners War add me - Strippin nnI need friends ._.
@leilaidrissova I hate that you are a snap chat filter baby it eats me up inside leila- you were supposed to bring balance not destroy us
@ZodicalCandy @DarkSoulsGame @SandersInk 
@bristol247 @SimonHoneydew Are the 10 things in this picture.
@Peeverson I'm hearing this word Bloodshades but I'm out of the loop. What manner of monster did you create.
Again, if you wanna play in @crendor and I's Bloodbowl 2 league make a new team and join 'Monday Night Fightz' - it'll be an ongoing thing
@mattplaysgame @crendor Monday Night Fightz is the league. Dismember September is the season.
10am and nearly everyone involved in the show last night is still passed the fuck out except @skinnyghost he's too powerful
@Ezekiel_III @MANvsGAME @aureylian @itmeJP @RollPlay hahaha
@HoustonxProblem insects always seek light homie
So many great moments from tonight I'm gonna need a shit load of @RollPlay fan art to enjoy
@HollyConrad @aureylian @RollPlay they were delicious
@Ezekiel_III @aureylian @itmeJP @RollPlay enjoy the future you lil bitch it's gonna be a treat
@JesseCox: That was the single greatest roleplaying ending in the history of all roleplaying games. Oh my god. @RollPlay #teamempire
Tweet us your thoughts during the @RollPlay show using the hashtag #rollplaylive
Thanks @aureylian for an amazing birthday dinner. 10 courses I'm stuffed 
.@itmeJP @aureylian apparently it feeds 180 people. Challenge accepted.
@CohhCarnage @cinnamontoastk DJ Superintendant Peehole in the house 
@ShannonZKiller the show is  you and @BeckettAngela would love it
@ShannonZKiller dress up like Vanessa from Penny Dreadful when you greet him
@ShannonZKiller Chris' dad is gonna show up and your house will be covered by a cloud of maggots and wasps like you're house holds true evil
@GoldenboyFTW her voice was trembling dude the idea of someone owning it on this tiny plane LOL
@HappiLeeErin @dnsievers appy birfday 
@TKbreezy @PlayMXM I respect you for asking the questions that matter TK
Flight attendant: "if you have a Samsung Galaxy note 7 please please do not turn it on during the flight"nnLegitimate fear in her voice
Screaming baby one seat in front of me it's looking at me as it unleashes it's banshee screamnn@itmeJP get the whisky ready
@MrMoon1000 @ProSyndicate Those DayZ days were 
Had to buy new tickets with another airline. @Delta coming to the rescue. Thus concludes our worst airport adventure ever.
Man I can't believe overselling a flight with non-refundable tickets is legal. They're literally stealing money from people. That's crazy.
Moral of the story is don't try and get the best price on a plane ticket because that airline won't give two shits if you make it or not.
@AmericanAir @JesseCox his co-workers aren't on the flight for one.
So @AmericanAir make me miss my first flight to Texas, I turn up early for the next flight only to be told they've oversold it. What a joke
@JesseCox: All packed and ready to spend 2 days with the @RollPlay Star Wars: Balance of Power crew. 8 hours of live imperial shenanigan
@LIRIK @shortyyguy I'm with Lirik on this one you've been too lucky from the start.
Pockets $200 lighter every month because I'm subbed to so many of my friends on twitch. I love you all but the herd must now be culled.
@_StylesX2 I don't run nowadays I just eat that is the D3 lifestyle
@_StylesX2 get these hands right now with your ass mewtwo nn Mr potato head lookin ass
When you wanna play 4 player co-op on stream and every single voice comms software has issues. Kill me
@Totalbiscuit Announcing me as the guest would've been the best possible way to do it but this is alright I guess.
@itmeJP @Twitch you aren't wearing it for an 8 hour show. RIP me
@skinnyghost yours would be plaid if it were possible, failing that probably all black
Me: "Huh. There's a FFX mod that turns all audio into Tidus' laugh.nn@dexbonus : "...Why do we play god"
@emilegauthier Hey Emile. For Honor team sent me your way re: thursdays alpha. Room for one more?
Didn't mean to send that tweet it wasn't finished help
Thanks for joining me for the annual birthday 24hr stream.
@kaitly_n @GeersArt you're just mad jelly of my humps
@dexbonus if I hit 1000 subs I said I'd shave my beard into mutton chops I may need you to return with a razor. Oops
@Kiwion @TehJamJar who the fuck turns down a bacon sarnie!?
@cinnamontoastk whenever we hang out my sex life turns into super smash bros
@VernonShaw THIS AGITATED STATE MAKES YOU RIPE FOR PREDATORS VERN. PROTECT THOSE CYCLE SHORTS
@VernonShaw Vern your neighbour likes Game Grumps that's pretty common, the FBI aren't looking for you relax hahaha
@SmashGrabGame Hey guys! Any chance I could try out the beta? Thanks!
@JKCompletesIt: Mark your calendars, folks! September 24th - Super Mario RPG stream is happening ! @JesseCox @dexbonus @Strippin @Octopi
No stream today as @dexbonus has put together a suprise birthday shindig for me. I'll be back tomorrow! Peace out mother fuckers
@aureylian @Ezekiel_III @IIJERiiCHOII what's the bet
Probably in the worst shape I've ever been in physically. Gotta step my game up. I'm awful at finding a good balance.
@blakinola Shaman is pretty damn fun but if not it sounds like you enjoy hybrids so I'd say try monk!
@blakinola Nah Ret Paladin is just dogshit this expansion bro. Try your hand at something else.
@therealzef I was literally thinking the same thing
Fuck @shortyyguy got a legendary in WoW I'm fucking tilted.
Well... We're gonna be live as soon as @Twitch permits it.
@MintyMinute @The_T I feel like raid healing is pretty easy compared to mythics where you are soley responsible for the other 4 peeps!
I stream DPS and I'm a god, I streamed my first healing dungeon today on NORMAL and i wiped my group. 
Tonight I'm going to a party then doing p90x then learning how to heal in WoW in that order and it's gonna go horribly wrong
@FaithJChoi: When @dexbonus BRB's from her stream because she's frustrated so we all head over to @Strippin 's because we know she'll ap
@AceyBongos @RareLtd so hyped for that game arghnnI mean yaaaaargh
@huffitypuffity @Elvinelol the crying face perfectly reflects my soul thanks bro
Seen so many broadcasters getting shit from their viewers for playing to much WoW but my audience is super chill you guys are awesome.
@Elvinelol I'm not even on the graphic that's how bad my chances are I'm fuckin triggered
@Elvinelol ...no nnI'm ilvl 847 with no legendary at this point it's a crime
@DistractedElf @twerp78 @Trash_Tier_Pro it was some good times
Haha @dexbonus remembered her keys this morning. We go to the garage and realize she left her car at her friends house. Pray for me.
@towelthetank massive achievement brother. Hammers up!
Streaming nice and early tomorrow for my EU peeps. Sorry I've been neglecting you my people. 
@SkyWilliams @ohnips @perepereden @ffSade sexual discrimination sky, reported
@InTheLittleWood found my pristine shenmue II copy for dreamcast in my old room at my parents house. 
@GeersArt ...I do look good though (   )
@GeersArt you made me stupidly hot in the BoP poster and now I have to dress like that in the live show you've ruined me
@itmeJP been here 2 days in a row and they just keep asking for more shit and sending me away so done
Opening a bank account in America is the dumbest shit help me
New Apple phone looks like all the rest with minimal new features they probably have had ready for years why are you kids hyped I don't even
If you use upside down smiley faces to express displeasure you are my mortal enemy.
@crendor the sealion is clearly the outsider in this pic but you wouldn't know about that you are too busy trying to be hip and relatable
@The_T Turps expectedly trying to game the system 
@itmeJP @LIRIK @timthetatman @shortyyguy I sent that to you 30 minutes ago you fraud
@FairlyAnon @EasyAllies @itmeJP @dexbonus I'm a unique snowflake ok man
@WishfuiiyTV @gmart711 @SelvekTV @GameWithMeTV 
@cinnamontoastk: Two dudes in front of me been trying to take a good pic using that dog snap chat shit five mins straight. I'm ready to
Big steam tomorrow weekly reset mythic dungeons probably @timthetatman going down on @shortyyguy who knows we get wild see you then.
Might stream tonight with the guys but @dexbonus gets home today and I'm pretty burnt out so we'll see. 70 hours streaming in 4 days = RIP
Seems like not a single Demon Hunter has had a Candrael's Charm drop yet in Suramar. If you've managed to get one let me know how!
@luxxbunny @BehkuhTweets @dexbonus yeah looks like a long haired version! Hopefully yours isn't also Satan
@luxxbunny @BehkuhTweets @dexbonus she's a flame point Siamese.
I'm about to go shit in her litter box this means war.
Watson tryna start shit before @dexbonus gets home tonight. Cat just locked eyes with me and pushed a glass off the counter and smashed it.
Listening to Electro-swing and eating cold buffalo wings in my underwear. Legion has ruined me. I am a shell of a man.
@aureylian been laughing my ass off at your profile pic for like 5 minutes solid. A+
Good stream homies. We'll get that Legendary soon. Big thank you to Pystro and Vailent for the generous tips tonight. Catch you tomorrow
"Suramar quests are literally you helping junkies take their city back" - @LIRIK 2016
@ShannonZKiller @jasonmaestas @Dansgaming oh my god Shan you are missing out so hard
Every time I finish streaming I just sit at my PC for an hour doing literally fuck all and am always like 'why did you do that' afterwards
@itmeJP @dexbonus she's already seen it without me.
@itmeJP I wanna see it if you wanna wait til I'm visiting
@shofu @YouTube 
@fairlightex this tweet implies someone actually...
@unitlostgaming to be fair you do have to stand still to type
Just grabbing some lunch and then we'll do an afternoon stream! Gonna play whatever you guys want.nnJk you idiots im playing WoW.
@JesseCox @Warcraft @crendor lol noobs I'm mythic geared
Streamed 36 hours of Legion in 2 days what the fuck is life
@jasonmaestas you promised you wouldn't tell anyone I'm secretly the owner and ceo of G2A
If I held a rap concert in my room and bought the only ticket am I technically performing a 'sold out' rap show? 
@J1tails what if he jerks off he's technically jerking off someone else 
Wow stream in a couple hours just getting breakfast. Where the squad at @shortyyguy @LIRIK @itmeJP @timthetatman
@timthetatman @LIRIK @itmeJP @shortyyguy Sunflowers in the chat
If you tuned in to the stream over the last 24 hours thank you!Now to pass the fuck out.
@itmeJP Sat in the discord BRO I don't see @shortyyguy
@jasonmaestas if I could like this twice I would
@sanjista but that's why stuff like seeding exists right so you can climb the ranks and reach that bar. It drives ambition
@cinnamontoastk @itmeJP @LIRIK @shortyyguy @timthetatman translation: I'm jealous of your snacks Sam
The FGCs failure to create a bar between the top players and the grass roots has hindered it's growth imo. Look at any successful esport.
@AlvaroFAraujo right but instead of just hoping 2000 people show respect you could just accommodate top 16 with a safe space
@AlvaroFAraujo @KBradJStorm saw it. Disagree entirely. Fighting games are in the Stone Age. Everyone else has adopted similar ideals.
@itmeJP @LIRIK @shortyyguy @timthetatman @dexbonus she's making me dinner like a trooper
@itmeJP @LIRIK @shortyyguy @timthetatman if you keep eating sugar you never crash JP it's fucking science ok
For those against a Smash VIP area...nnIt's a spectator sport. Why the fuck wouldn't you want to produce the best matches possible? Madness
@itmeJP @Fail_lula @GiantWaffle @Warcraft I saw multiple feral Druids in the first leveling zone on EU with their artifacts
@OMGitsfirefoxx @itmeJP S U B Z E R O T E M P E R A T U R E S
@GennaBain I'm so disappointed that you failed to read my mind amongst my vague tweeting 
@GennaBain wow ok let me break it down. nnYou have Doritos and Mtn Dew and you also have a belt made out of old dorito bags for your dew
@GennaBain make a belt out of rolled up dorito bags
@AnneMunition Anne I've been thinking you were an android for a while now this confirms my suspicions
@JustinWong I take my coffee like my heart. black, Mr. Wong
Just went to my local diner and the waiter predicted my drink and food. I am ashamed.
I know some of you guys like that heavy grungy shit honestly you do you no hate.nnI just think you're all androids.
I'm sat next to @dexbonus recoiling at this awful music and she's so blissfully unaware just smiling and driving. I know she's an android
Get in the car to head to the office and @dexbonus puts on heavy metal??nnWhere is my betrothed who is this fucking imposter
L E G I O N B O I S - 24hr @Warcraft stream with @LIRIK @shortyyguy @itmeJP @timthetatman starting around 10.30pm PST
@itmeJP @LIRIK @Warcraft @timthetatman @shortyyguy they can only detain me for 24 hours I'll still make the stream ez
@itmeJP @LIRIK @Warcraft @timthetatman @shortyyguy I'm currently going through customs told border patrol to get their dicks out for legion
@itmeJP @LIRIK @Warcraft @timthetatman @shortyyguy I gotta do my giant shop tomorrow afternoon
@itmeJP @timthetatman @shortyyguy @LIRIK on a fucking plane
@MrMoon1000 @gmart711 @Kiwion @FailtimeFig @TheGamingDeadTv @WorldsAdrift got your back Moon. Let's go
Twitter gonna need some likes on that last tweet I'll let the chair stream tomorrow as payment 
.@VirginAtlantic free upgrade to upper class and I'll give you a shoulder rub? 
@hildewereld @VirginAtlantic 
Garunteed there's some 5ft tall person sat in them when I board just giving me the middle finger.
Checked in late and all the leg room seats in my @VirginAtlantic flight are taken. RIP legs it was a good run 
@unitlostgaming @OverwatchGG @OverwatchEU @PlayOverwatch 
@Jack_Septic_Eye @pewdiepie I'm triggered just thinking about it
@unitlostgaming @OverwatchGG @OverwatchEU @PlayOverwatch pretty average mate 
@JonsandmanTv am I gonna get home and turn my US phone on and see a huge angry girlfriend message from you
I'll also be doing a 24 hour stream Monday night for the Legion launch with @itmeJP @shortyyguy @timthetatman and @LIRIK - so hyped
Just boarding my flight back home. Apologies for the week away. We'll be back streaming tomorrow!
@aureylian @McDonalds I'm JPs boy toy and he loves it 
@GameWithMeTV @TheJoefudge91 @gmart711 fuck me Mitch back in your day ark was real life #dinosaur
@JenabellaFawn it was only 30 bucks if you recruit a legacy account 
@itshafu @JesseCox @crendor hi hafu nope Twitchcon then blizzcon for me thanks for asking friend
@JenabellaFawn I ended up recruiting myself the other week for the mount. I have no shame
@TheJoefudge91 @gmart711 I've been told 10-12 hours for 100-110 so totally do-able
@EllohimeTwitch tuned in to you making a deer experience death over and over again. 11/10
Showing my 4 year old nephew how to play Street Fighter and he's already better than me. 
@jackfrags I got DUDE with my A-levels. We are the chosen ones
@LittleWulfie Yeah I wouldn't care but I generally thought we had a blast in the FC back in the day.
@SkyWilliams @shofu @Chief_Brooks sky with the killing blow. nnI also agree anime was over when L died.
Just played a horror game on the HTC Vive, hid under a bed from a killer, he found me and I was murdered. 10/10
I'm getting withdrawal symptoms from not streaming straight up.
Man I'm not sure how you climb ranked in SFV when everytime I beat someone higher ranked than me they disconnect.Shits whack.
@Pokketsays hahaha I just selfied in the dark. 
@CaitlinDelia @gmart711 @KingBendrick oooo how do we tell her gmart. This is awkward
Bought my mum a HTC Vive for her birthday and she tried it today for the first time and lost her damn mind 
May not be able to stream until I get back on Sunday. Really sorry guys
Spent a bunch of money on a portable streaming set-up so I could stream from the UK visiting my mum but did no anticipate 0.5mb upload. RIP
@gmart711 @RollPlay Jon Snow would get killed a second time if he steps to Galahan mate
Twitter night mode is so much better I'm never turning it off. EVEN DURING THE DAY
If you clutch out a win and then don't run it back and flee with the points in SFV ranked you are my mortal enemy and I hate you.
@KingBendrick @gmart711 @toasterwoman @crendor im sobbing
@gmart711 @toasterwoman @KingBendrick @crendor L M F A OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@sherlock_hulmes oh totally I just wanted to take a swing at pathfinder 
@sherlock_hulmes they're probably playing pathfinder
@leilaidrissova @dexbonus I did just leave my favourite hat on the plane and lose it forever so we're pretty much soul mates
@dexbonus honey NOOOOOOOO 
On episode 4 of Penny Dreadful and so far it's been incredible.
I don't wanna talk about the stream today lets all just move on with our lives
Thinking of doing Divinity Original Sin with Benji and Gmart using the 4 player mod today if I can figure out how to set it up.
Ok I think the Bastion @PlayOverwatch short is my favorite to date. I swear they keep getting better.
@shofu @KeitaroTime I mean if shofu can get sponsored anyone can
I catch you posting spoilers about the bastion short in my timeline before I get into work you'll meet a worse fate than PTR Genji
@Jack_Septic_Eye I've been trying to find the right guy to get a dark souls one for a while now.
@Jack_Septic_Eye woah dude is that a Bloodborne tat!? Looks awesome
Some of you have struggled since May 24th. For me, it's been over a year of struggle. Finally we all have justice. nnGenji is nerfed.
@TKbreezy Why you playing with our hearts writing Powerstone 3
Apparently I missed a couple of subs towards the end of the stream there. Apologies guys, thanks for the support!
@AmarielleEU You should probably listen to his voice again in that link lol
@BikeManStream When's it actually playable? I'm so hyped!
Streaming a little later with the Household boys playing some Miscreated. See you then!
@Kiwion @MrMoon1000 He looks weak in this photo and definitely not in his prime. I'm glad things have changed since then.
@shofu You tryna make me go high tier shofu? What about dedede or zelda man
Set up Smash 4 today for the first time in like a year and I have no idea who to play.
My mobile @Twitch app only works with wifi but not with 3G/4G is that normal?
@itmeJP @towelthetank You aren't wearing the shirt wtf
@JonsandmanTv Jon the question is what is wrong with everyone else for NOT writing raps about beards.
Just getting some food a  ' nnWill stream after I've eaten!
@therealzef Tryna set it up today wanna get my Ganon back in the game
@therealzef Yo when is that new Smash melee netplay thing coming out? Wanna get on that but forgot what date its launching.
@CrikMaster @JonsandmanTv after watching your vampire masquerade streams I kid you not it is based on this place. It's unreal
Guys @JonsandmanTv and I went to a gothic club for a laugh in LA. Before the night ends we will become vampire thralls. Goodbye my friends
Got a whoppin' headache guys so gonna take it easy. If it clears up later we'll do a little evening stream. Sorry broski's
Gonna do another evening stream tonight guys, I'll let you know before I go live!
You guys can roll horde on my server if you want instead and I'll just TEABAG YOUR FUCKING CORPSE :)
Recruiting for my EU WoW guild. (Defias Brotherhood, Alliance) hit me up if you wanna play with myself, @crendor, @gmart711 @KingBendrick :)
@andoackerman all the raps after this one were written by chat though it was a group effort haha
@andoackerman LOL I just secured a shadow writer so it'll be more legit going forward
@andoackerman Nah bro I was reading it straight off of google.
@MattyBoyHouston oh shit lil tea gonna level up tomorrow
@MattyBoyHouston I need a new shadow writer after my last one got set on fire I feel like you are the man for the job
That was the stream to revive the youtube channel. The adventures of Lil Tea must be documented.
@JesseCox @dexbonus @larianstudiosall we need is @crendor for the perfect squad
@JesseCox: @dexbonus @Strippin @larianstudios We are playing it..it's happening.
So @JesseCox and I spent the afternoon with @larianstudios getting a hands on with Divinity 2. Game is incredible I am so hyped.
@ShannonZKiller but you are a Canadian brown bear beauty you must embrace it. Do it for @Sacriel42
@kristenhazard @JesseCox @leilaidrissova @dexbonus @crendor @toasterwoman this tweet chain is just perfect
My uber driver is driving so fast that my day is actually becoming more hype as the risk to my life goes up. Let's goooo
@Kiwion @SelvekTV @MrMoon1000 depends can you cope with English banter
@Kiwion @SelvekTV @MrMoon1000 I do it every season  (I also die and lose the character every season)
@BacchusofKent It's a very well documented progressive hatred that formed over multiple weeks actually
In light of @Pokemon worlds and @PokemonGoApp burning the franchise I expect Sun and Moon to not even exist it's just an elaborate troll
@AmarielleEU Cant say the same about your transmog but thanks for the tip Kappa
1 week before @Pokemon World Championships, they announce the venue is closed to the public. If you planned the trip consider a refund asap.
Stream a little later than usual today as I'm meeting with some game devs shortly!
@toasterwoman @leilaidrissova what buy Doritos and Mountain Dew and play video games...?
@therealzef I get it. I posted my 7 last week I'm a ground type guy haha.
Kinda really want a @htcvive for some VR streams. How long do they take to arrive?
@MrMoon1000 @TheJoefudge91 If I needed a reason to play this game tomorrow, it happened in that clip.
@MrMoon1000 @TheJoefudge91 Best moment of my life
One of my favorite streams for as long as I can remember today. Thanks for hanging out guys - see you tomorrow!
@TheBaconBoots: Poor @strippin. he was so young, so innocent. Then the Twitch memes arrived.
@HeyDmart held it down, was about to sail to island number 5 to end my stream and accidentally sailed back to island 1 instead! Hahaha
@HeyDmart I think the problem was it was winter so they wouldn't plant new farms? Is that a thing?
@HeyDmart Yo! Is there a bug with farmers just NOT DOING THEIR JOB!? haha
@MrMoon1000 you tried just right clicking them and 'save as' ?
@therealzef LOL this tweet spoke to me on a personal level
I'm just kidding it was 100% the parody account. Had to do a double take though haha.
@pokelawls I watched the youtube vid you did and I was cry laughing bro
@noionl Hey Tom. Would it be possible to grab a copy of Kingdom: New Lands for my stream tomorrow? I'm hyped!
@OMGitsAliA haven't played for over a week and you are still behind in levels 
@ShannonZKiller @dexbonus Can't wait to see you and Chris and hang out.

@Pokketsays Pokemon games have sold 253 million units worldwide...
Hey guys no stream this afternoon as I'm taking Birfday gurl @dexbonus out for a birfday dinner. We'll go hard this weekend.
@InsertCoinTees @Pokemon 
@blakinola American girls dig the English my friend. 
@CohhCarnage @dexbonus dude I'm so sorry although apparently I was your right hand man so my sympathy is expected
@CohhCarnage: So they say that dreams are subconscious urges breaking into our reality...nn...nn...nn...nn...nnLookin' at you @dexbonus!
@LIRIK difference is our teeth shit is free 
Margot Robbie is an amazing Harley though, god damn.
Just saw Suicide Squad. It was enjoyable. Sadly there's yet to be a DC movie that's even come close to The Dark Knight trilogy.
@Mort3mer is that so...  maybe I gotta go fast
@Mort3mer  they were made for your collection
God damn @ForHonorGame is so good I'm losing my mind when this game comes out I am lost to the drums of viking war. Hail Odin.
@ForHonorGame hey guys any chance I can get in on the Technical Alpha? I was invited by a friend but it doesn't seem to have worked. Thanks!
I recon Sombra is ready for release on @PlayOverwatch but they won't release her until we beat the ARG
@fairlightex @ForHonorGame Vikings 4yfe. Watch your back FairKNIGHT
Sorry guys no stream today as I have a hot date with the US Government but we'll be back tomorrow.
@omfgblondie @crendor you can believe me right now it tastes A LOT worse
@pokelawls I still think about you now and then and what could have been
@visecs I'm laughing hard at some of the tweets though oh my lord
If you can't tell I'm finding this Drake/Eminem rumor to be hilarious 
...I don't understand. Just trying to understand Niantic is hurting me on a spiritual level.
@Mort3mer @PlayOverwatch haha nah they sent it to me!
@Timmac_ 
@notquitefrodo @ivyleaguepunk It's a hack, all of the 'witnesses' were in on it using a client side program to make a vaporeon into articuno
@warpzonetweets I'm just so incredibly bummed out that an IP I love has been driven into a wall at top speed.
Devoid of communication makes Niantic look underhanded and incompetent. They are a poster boy for what not to do as a game developer.
They're deliberately removing tracking and upping difficulty to make players spend MORE money, 10 million dollars a day isn't enough I guess
I'm being told @NianticLabs secretly made it around 50% harder to catch pokemon with the latest Pokemon GO update. Jesus christ.
@albiononline Hey guys, would I be able to get a couple of keys to show the game off today on Twitch? Thanks!
@SelvekTV @Kiwion Kiwos 'art' makes me legit uncomfortable every single time I see it
New Bourne movie was awesome and the Bourne franchise as a whole is definitely one of my all-time favorites.
I'm on NA for those asking. Stream in an hour? 2pm PST. We'll attempt HFC Heroic with viewers
Could I realistically do a WoW HFC Heroic with viewers? I wanna get the moose mount before Legion.
@GoldenboyFTW latest update removed ALL ways to locate Pokemon I have no idea what they're doing but that was the games ONLY feature lol
Proves how powerful Pokemon is as a brand, if this was any other AR game they'd be in the dumpster
Wow, woke up to find @NianticLabs has just executed themselves samurai style with terrible design choices in the new PokemonGO update. RIP
Switching my day off from tomorrow to today so I can watch @RollPlay Court of Swords and hang out with @CrikMaster - see ya then nerds
@itmeJP you were even yelling it in my chat yesterday
@dexbonus: I hope everyone's having an awesome time at @CoxConOfficial  sorry we can't be there this year but we'll make sure next year
@Bianca_X23: "Look they had to give me something wrong otherwise I'll be perfect." - @Strippin on his colour blindness
@IIJERiiCHOII @aureylian we've created a monster
@IIJERiiCHOII @aureylian woah what the fuck is that bro woaaah
@aureylian @Superfight nFlynAsn
Great stream guys, @Superfight was great fun and got so many transmogs. Gonna look fly as hell
Seriously I need to win so I can get my ass bleached get in here.
@PokeVisionGo I can't even do it WITH pokevision
I planned this all along totally didn't think it was London
By the way that was a picture of Sydney not London get trolled kids
The real question is... Where did the Drowzee go (   )
@Strippin @leilaidrissova you left London and it became shrouded in darkness attracting hundreds of Zubats. RIP
@therealzef figured I'd ask if you'd tried it to see if it was good as seems like your thing.
@therealzef nah not yet will try it tonight looks decent though
Oh shit all the Pokemon spawns have changed Santa Monica Pier is now infested with Jinx
@GennaBain you are my beacon in the dark Genna, make Valor proud
@AmarielleEU I click it and just are @Besso0_007 say "are you periscoping? Fuck you" hahaha
Go forth and claim the Coxcon venue gym for Team Valor my warriors.
@KingBendrick @CaitlinDelia We're going on a journey Benji baggins
@CaitlinDelia @KingBendrick Only 1 spoons in fucking telford m8
Thanks for hanging out in the stream today! See you at 2pm PDT tomorrow for the SuperFight tournament
@Crumps2 @Twitch I had a day off yesterday myself mate haha , and trust me botters aren't my co-workers.
@ProSyndicate @dexbonus 
Man all the partnered @Twitch broadcasters spontaneously taking a day off because their viewbot sites are down is fucking hilarious.
@Renessa47 
The team instinct leader looks like a chill dude who knows what's what I'm valor but his constant depiction as a retard is annoying me.
@OMGitsAliA @YouTube your CP calculator just told me my charizard is 400 cp weaker than average so I gotta go get another one smh
@dexbonus: @Strippin WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO LEAVE ME 
Guys @dexbonus takes it personally when a Pokemon runs and gets all upset like the games implying she'd be a terrible mother nnHelp
@OMGitsfirefoxx making valor proud 
@Elvinelol dude I tried to message you and accidentally unfollowed I've been following you forever! 
@Elvinelol show me the ways of making gold in WoW dude
@Gurkensushi @itmeJP He was crazy good looking are you INSANE?
@ChetIrons what? Dragon claw is the third strongest move in the entire game mate lol
@skinnyghost: @Strippin bro. I will always be your bro, bro.
@skinnyghost bro. Let's walk off into the sunset bro
@fairlightex @AnthonyKongphan so underrated, some of my favorite titles
@AnthonyKongphan @fairlightex Ogre Battle is L E G I T
If I ever find someone IRL selling bootleg versions of Dodgers shirts you can be absolutely certain they will catch these fuckin' hands.
Guys how hard is Starbound Hardcore? About to stream it with Benji and we're debating it.
I'm being boosted through the WoW raid for the Moose mount, will stream as soon as I'm done B)
@TulceRaye saw her at anime expo and @andybelford thought I'd imagined it
Just saw the new Star Trek movie and it's absolutely awesome!
@PokeVisionGo I need you I'm out catching Pokemon help
@hotted89 @dexbonus @FacianeA @PokeKellz I don't even know how dude haha
Stream will be later this evening as I'm out on a poke adventure with @dexbonus @FacianeA and @PokeKellz 
@LittleNommer @cuppbubbletea I thought that was a white glove and it was your hand 
@IncredibleOrb Haha I've been working my ass off to get good with her she's awesome
I think part of it is that you visually see Mercys contribution in a match, and for Ana its very easy overlook the contribution she makes.
People lose their shit when I pick Ana in ranked despite healing for the same numbers as when I play Mercy. :(
People saying "thats the point of a support" are moronic. Sorry but recognizing amazing supportive play is equally as important.
I feel like Ana will never get Play of the Game in Overwatch. Every Ana play I've seen has gone to the guy who got the kills with her buff.
@fairlightex @IIJERiiCHOII @PlayOverwatch Aye, he was supposed to be the counter to Tracer/Genji not snipers so idk what they're up to
@fairlightex @IIJERiiCHOII @PlayOverwatch You can now 2-tap someone with Mcree at the same distance and time frame as a one tap Widow though
@IIJERiiCHOII @PlayOverwatch A sniper used to be part of the line-up, now it's a 'maybe' and Mcree is just a better sniper?
@unitlostgaming @OverwatchGG @OverwatchFeed Yup I hate you
@DimitrisPhotos @MrMoon1000 Truth, I fuck it up every day
@unitlostgaming @OverwatchGG @OverwatchFeed If this is clickbait you're fucking dead m8
@NathanZed @Forbes 
@CohhCarnage oh my god I didn't recognize it was you until I heard your voice 
Tried Rimworld. Shits too complicated. Couldn't even figure out how to feed my three little people and they starved. RIP
@FacianeA Fuck I clicked this on a whim and like 30 seconds in I got roasted did NOT see that coming.
How do I get a US WoW account on my battlenet if the only thing I can buy is EU :(
They were probably all team Instinct let's be real
@jasonmaestas @ShannonZKiller made me laugh out loud A+
@ShannonZKiller no she picked them off the tree and they all just chowed down and kept walking? America?
My park adventure went from Disney to only witness to murder before my fucking incense ran out
Mother: "isn't nature wonderful"n*Daughter grabs handful of poison berries*n*Family all enjoy some berries each and keep walking*nnWHAT!?
@CaitlinDelia @leilaidrissova oh no you right the grey one is the EU one that fucks shit up I'm colorblind
@CaitlinDelia @leilaidrissova other way round. Red Squirrels are the smaller fucking savage ones in the UK who kill the grey ones
@CaitlinDelia American squirrels are the passive cousin of the British monsters
Dude this squirrel has gargantuan balls they're like space hoppers
@Nidalevi i miss all of you except @Quorraa 
@ShannonZKiller this one likes Mexican food he knows what's up
Sat at the park. A squirrel comes up and takes food out of my hand. Is this what it's like to be outside!? This is some magical Disney shit
@IIJERiiCHOII you'll bounce back bro 
@notquitefrodo I'm going there on my day off on Wednesday and I'll leave with a god tier Zard.
@CaitlinDelia cox con isn't in America leave your freedom at home
@CaitlinDelia in England your 'mug' means your face just FYI
Streaming Street Fighter V in an hour and I've been practicing all weekend I actually ranked up 
@shofu @PGOTeamValor @dexbonus You fucked up SO bad bro
Can I point out this all stemmed from her telling someone not to join team red I just found it suspicious that's all
@itmeJP: @Strippin SAM IF YOU'RE READY TO LEAVE IM READY TO LEAVE JUST LEMME KNOW WE CAN FINALLY DROP THESE SHACKLES AND BE FREE
@RatingHyperion @dexbonus im the strongest team red in the world 
Sooo I wanna watch Dragonball Super but people are saying I should watch a DBZ movie and skip a bunch of eps as it's better?
@JustinWong She has no chill man she is just roasting you left and right
Rest now, our sweet prince. You fought valiantly @thisislijoe
JOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
If you are upset by EVO being on ESPN2 you need to hop on the first ride off of this planet because this is just the beginning baby
Never in my life have I wanted someone to succeed as much as I do LI Joe oh my lord the hype
Oh shit, EVO Japan. The world must travel to the homeland of fighting games...
I just popped off in my living room S2J is a god #falconmainsenpai
@aureylian   
Went to the museum to catch Charmanders. Pokemon GO wouldn't work the whole time. Had to actually see the museum. Game is ruining my life.
Keemstar has joined his brethren on Team Mystic 
Pokemon GO servers just went down as I'm in the car driving to a cool spot to catch Pokemon what the fuck is this amateur hour
@dexbonus your allegiance to our great leaders side boob is lacking and that is why you are weak.
@OMGitsfirefoxx 
I picked Team Valor because the team leader had hot side boob I have ZERO regrets
@pewdiepie @crendor i dnt eat my own shit mate i eat a dif kindof shit called 'team mystic'
@pewdiepie @crendor explains why your pokemon are so weak and why you will never have a gf tema mystic suks
@pewdiepie They are adding the next generation of pokemon in the next 5 months or so
@kristenhazard @MathasGames @notquitefrodo @crendor @aureylian Sure you have kiddo. Sure you have.
@PrometheanLIVE They wanted them reserved for 'friendlies' I hear and were utterly uncooperative
@jimmywhis the one that broke my spine I remember you well 
@PrometheanLIVE they were forced to only use half the set-ups resulting in a super late finish and very early start amongst other stuff.
As a spectator EVO is great but it's sad to hear lots of pro smashers talk about the awful conditions this year. EVO Staff need to fix up.
Sorry guys I had plans to stream today but EVO has been so incredible today I've been glued to the screen. 24hr stream Monday? Maybe?
Congratulations to @AllyOrNotAlly who fucking KILLED it at EVO. If this man isn't sponsored by next week I lose hope for esports
@PhillyD awesome meeting you yesterday, have a good one!
This morning I heard @dexbonus yell 'cold showers are good for you!!!' followed by about 2 minutes of screaming 
@twirlyswirly @Twitch totally agree. Honestly the emotes is what has upset me.
@twirlyswirly yeah I feel you but I'll now have 5 dumb US voting emotes to moderate + new viewers with a political agenda as a result.
@twirlyswirly as someone who asks people to refrain from the discussion as to not alienate viewers and; keep it an entertaining space I won't.
@DaveC954 it actively brings tons of toxic political discussion to the site it has literally nothing to do with watching it mate.
Disregarding the fact that a huge portion of Twitch isn't even American???
Love that 99% of twitch streamers enforce 'no politics discussions' in their streams as its so toxic and @Twitch just didn't get the memo?
@dexbonus naw it was gone before i left the house ._.
@sanjista dude I've never even seen one that's dope
This morning I couldn't get dressed fast enough to catch the Jolteon down the street and I am starting the day sad and defeated
He slowly tips his fedora forward, his wicked hipster grin shines pearly white teeth as he begins to type...nn"Pokemon GO players are sheep"
@gmart711 @dexbonus fuck that made me laugh so hard you blues are witty folk
@shofu @YouTube you running for that shit is my favorite thing this week man
@notquitefrodo @jfwong @ivyleaguepunk @YouTubeSpaceLA and you get up to 35 candy per hatch so you get a ton of evolutions too
@notquitefrodo @jfwong @ivyleaguepunk @YouTubeSpaceLA also hatching eggs. Buy 9 incubators to hatch 9 at a time for crazy gains
Thanks for the 200k followers you jerks. No stream today as I'm heading to the YouTube Space in LA to do something fun (i hope?)
@MrErnestLe I don't suppose there are Zubats near you, bro?
@ObsceneSlightly @NECROPOLIS_game I didn't know Zeke was joining us, awesome
Captured a gym last night with @dexbonus before someone captured it from us. Turns out it was @SkyWilliams 
@dexbonus @kristenhazard yeah next time we go you're coming!
@AKAReject @trottimus @Cactus_Matt amazing gif usage
@AKAReject @trottimus @Cactus_Matt y'all are just drama queens
@trottimus @Cactus_Matt Mate you honestly think Nintendo would let that happen?
Going to COXCON? Make sure you paint that building red with your Pokemon. Make that shit Valor territory
Happy Birthday to my homeslice @gmart711 1 year older 1 more year of regret for naming yourself after a convenience store.
@dexbonus @shofu @PokeKellz You abandoned me shofu
@kristenhazard @dexbonus I don't think you fully understand the situation. Team Red is in the building. The gym is ours.
@Proasheck @The_T you're right. I knew you were equally awesome and red that was a test
@The_T what level is it? Just throw a pokeball m8 free exp
Real talk though Blue Team are all talk and if I see you trying to hold down a gym my 1400 Snorlax is gonna bop you Red 4 lyfe.
@therealzef you probably picked blue like everyone else huh
Went around with red and blues in a makeshift 'Team Purple' tonight with the sole purpose of crushing crappy Yellow. United by a common foe
@JesseCox Yeah it's Team Red and you had your chance to join us and chickened out
@The_T @ProSyndicate Tell me about it bro. Also what ARE the odds of that because fuck me it's slim!
@shortyyguy We've all felt your struggle man. Bring it in.
@J1tails @NianticLabs alright I'll give that a try
@JenabellaFawn @ProSyndicate Santa Monica Pier it's INSANE (and a nice day out?)
3 days in a row I've been unable to capture a single gym because they are so bugged not sure why they are even in the game? @NianticLabs
Heard there was a great spot for catching Pokemon in LA, went there today and just bumped into @ProSyndicate who was also poke hunting 
@itmeJP: @Strippin THATS WHAT IM FUCKING TALKIN ABOUT LETS GO BIG RED KEEP FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT I PUNKED SOME FUCKING BLUE GYM EARLIE
I'm driving around with a bunch of Team Red friends in 2 identical red cars capturing gyms in LA. You literally couldn't get more meta
Guys if you curve your pokeball throw in Pokemon GO the ball starts glowing? Did I just discover a secret technique?
Dude in the Verizon store is trying to sell me a Verizon tablet whilst using an iPad in his other hand???
Sorry about all the technical issues with the new office. Hopefully it'll all get resolved soon. I'm gutted!
@JesseCox @DemonLemming @itmeJP @dexbonus Primarily because every time I try and take the gym it bugs out and stops me :(
@notquitefrodo (that means I have nothing strong enough to beat that)
@notquitefrodo I'll keep my cards close to my chest for now. 
@sanjista if it gets stuck close the software and re open it it's a known bug
@notquitefrodo when big boy falls he's gonna fall hard.
@notquitefrodo better watch out when I visit cos I'm claiming Riot for V A L O R
Tomorrow I take over the office Pokemon Gym for good. Praise Moltres, valor for lyfe
Went for an hour and a half Pokemon adventure with @dexbonus and she was so tired when we got home she passed out immediately
I think I've hit a wall with Ibuki as a new player. What characters would you suggest for me to try?
Someone let me know when PokemonGO is up on the West Coast, can't be bothered to enter gmail info into my phone anymore. Life is worthless
@HenryClay Man you sinned shaving that bad boy off, you looked handsomely rugged as fuck
It's pretty amazing how this game has forced so many people to go outside and walk around though real talk
We will be back in the Street Fighter V lab this afternoon. I practiced til midnight last night so hopefully I'm not as awful
@PhillyD: Everyone deserves a partner that goes down on them as often as #PokemonGo servers do...
@Jack_Septic_Eye @dexbonus I'll bug her and find out!
Just spent an hour learning how to play Guilty Gear until I realised I'm playing the old one and the new one isn't ok PC. RIP
Yo @FacianeA @JesseCox @dexbonus @PokeKellz can we have a joint theme for our gym
I hope you have to legit catch a bus to buy your pokeballs
People took both my and @dexbonus names and all their variations I hope your nearest poke stop is 6 miles away you assholes
Taking @dexbonus up the street to the Drug Barens house so she can get her Bulbasaur we are committed stay tuned
I made that 'getting kill in LA by Pokemon GO' tweet as a joke but @dexbonus bulbasaur is straight up waiting at the drug dealers house???
@leilaidrissova @JesseCox @CokeEsports Leila you can't let him get away with this
@JesseCox @CokeEsports I.... I don't know how I should feel
@JesseCox @CokeEsports it's not Mexican Coke it's the Coke used in the REST OF THE WORLD you ignorant murican
I'm watching Naruto for the first time tonight and it's literally just a terrible 80s cartoon please tell me it gets better
Fully expecting to be stabbed by a gang in LA whilst hunting night Pokemon as soon as Pokemon GO is out in the US
Stream will be a little later. If @crendor shows up we'll do some Baldurs Gate 2! If not I think we'll try Helldivers!
@arrowheadgs that would be amazing game looks really fun!
Fabulous shitshow of a stream guys - see you tomorrow! Enjoy your 4th of July.
Gunz2 was a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE mistake never play this game ever.
@AnneMunition I'm just scurred to play ranked without my froinds :(
@SquirrelPowa @WishfuiiyTV Civ5 is maybe one of the most boring games every made though
Anyone got any fun multiplayer games for me and the boys to play today?
@Pokketsays @itmeJP @kaitly_n Your link is actually cheaper too lol RIP me good job kiddo
@itmeJP @kaitly_n ASSUMED WE WERE GONNA TAKE THAT SHIT TO DMS
@kaitly_n Yeah i've only had it a few days but it's really nice TB recommended it
Just tried to jump up like 5 steps on a staircase but I was wearing flip-flops and I mega ate shit
Awesome meeting and hanging out with @TheNo1Alex tonight!
Central Intelligence was great my face hurts from grinning @TheRock killed it.
I feel like this got too real too fast happy 4th July weekend you fucking traitors
Real talk, not sure what I'm supposed to do on 4th July living in America when I'm British and the celebration is you all abandoning us.
@xD1x @TheJWittz you got a link so I can binge it when I get back?
All I wanted at anime expo was a dope print of All Might and there isn't a single one. You weebs fucked up
@cinnamontoastk "Who's that CinnamonToasty friend of yours I like him"nn- My mother.
@gmart711 @kristenhazard mine is Corey in the house
@ohnips @dexbonus 
@ThePlutooo @OMGitsfirefoxx @Attack I have to be a good day to be a good time to get a new one is a great day for me to be a good day to be
I just saw 2 dudes dressed as sailors with a banner of a girl who was half waifu half battleship I can't
We are trying to find parking and @dexbonus is just yelling Japanese words loudly I'm already tilted
@ohnips where are you I'm coming to hunt you down
No stream today guys I am putting on pants to go to anime expo. Feel free to say hi if you see @dexbonus and I
Is it bad that I kinda wanna stream freestyle 2 again
I hear the pit patter of tiny feet on the stairs followed by @dexbonus yelling "I got so mad on my stream HUG ME"
@pewdiepie ...I trusted you. I thought you were Senpai and you drop this shit in my lap.
Going to be at Anime Expo on Saturday. Give me strength. I'm legit terrified
@WishfuiiyTV @TwitchSupport Because you gotta report the channel so they can process it.
@WishfuiiyTV @TwitchSupport Its crazy against ToS what?
@JesseCox @CaitlinDelia @pottermore to I got Wampus but it says it's the warrior house so that's pretty accurate.
Hypothetically if i was going to give my all for EVO and get in the lab should it be for smash 4 or street fighter V?
@SomaJT first time in my life I'll confess to be excited about having a schedule! Ha
Moved into my new office today! Will bestreaming from there tomorrow 
@ShannonZKiller I've read it and I still don't understand it. It's a backbone emote of twitch. Might as well just retire Kappa too
@ShannonZKiller @TwitchSupport why is ResidentSleeper gone?
@JesseCox you literally copied @aureylian though
@zillieness I just don't want aspiring female cosplayers to look at it and go 'huh if I cross play I need to sexualise it to get noticed'
That's a dope cosplay don't get me wrong, just something I see often and it irks me
@LIRIK you really captured her essence with this photo
@dexbonus: So glad all the oppressed heterosexuals are finally getting their chance to be heard and overcome hardships today LOL #Hetero
Everyone and their fucking dog has decided they want to be a healer in @PlayOverwatch but only in Competitive mode. Guess I'm out of a job.
@ohnips @dexbonus I need that mercy butt and I need it now
. @Sacriel42 @Arclegger @Twitch Twitch should send them all a sweater they look cold.
@ThePlutooo we are no longer friends you're gonna need new accommodation for anime expo
@OMGitsAliA @Vikkstar123 yeah they have a point mate
@dexbonus @JesseCox @PlayOverwatch @Sohinki This is why I main Mercy. No-one can ever bitch lol
@MarkPurdy1337 @PlayOverwatch totally untrue if you are playing against a premade when solo queueing and can't co-ordinate a stack counter
@LimeWeavile @PlayOverwatch None of that's good for a ranked environment and suddenly it's less about skill and more about gaming the system
@LimeWeavile @PlayOverwatchPre-mades stack vs solo queues who can't co-ordinate counters. Teams stack Tracer to prolong overtime.
I feel like at the very least @PlayOverwatch needs to look at limiting hero stacking in ranked before it turns into a shit show.
YO @itmeJP GET READY FOR 'TEXIT' YOU GUYS ARE NEXT
What the fuck is happening at CEO it's like the Smash Twilight Zone
@trottimus @alsmiffy have you seen the Pokemon trainer campaign?
@alsmiffy @trottimus you guys should pick up a Star Wars campaign they're so good
Apparently Trump is visiting England later today. nn...Not now you fucking muppet we're busy.
Our own Prime Minister just noped the fuck out. He dipped so fast probably heading for France.
I'm going to sleep and I'm praying my country is fixed when I wake up good bye.
Somehow Dark Souls III multiplayer is broken as fuck right now so we're moving over to Roguelands!
@ProSyndicate Happy Birthday homie. Have a wild one!
@JesseCox: The eyes of the world are upon you Britain. Good night, and good luck.
Just about to go to bed. Hopefully @dexbonus doesn't try and fight anymore swarms of bees in her sleep my ribs are feeling fragile.
@therealzef people thinking they are above themselves is ruining lives, my man paper mario is out here chillin.
@therealzef your profile pic just made me laugh real hard.
@ohnips Hanzo is Daddy you are mistaken this man is not your biological father he is evil
@therealzef @xD1x @McDareth @gsmVoiD @PG_Dom @_StylesX2 I feel like it's missing a sub button you know?
Had a fantastic day at Disneyland with some fantastic people. Back streaming tomorrow! If you are going to Vidcon be safe and have fun!
@IncredibleOrb grab the back of the bench for that lat flex I see you
I thought we were being attacked in our hotel room I lept up and realised it was her. She was my attacker. 
Last night @dexbonus had a dream she was being attacked, woke up and fuckin' haymakered me in the ribs.
Just know I'll be hitting you guys with a smile and a schedule soon. I appreciate all the support immensely.
Sounds dumb but things like getting homesick and struggling to acclimatise still happen to me in the US and it can derail my work ethic.
I've been dragging my feet as a broadcaster in recent weeks and we're gonna fix that up asap and get back to having some fun.
@musicaltheaterk @Jack_Septic_Eye that is the realest tweet I've read all night.
@siniaho @Jack_Septic_Eye handcuffs and a good right hook.
@itmeJP @IIJERiiCHOII my tastebuds got tastefully fucked
Two cops just walked past me and; as an Englishman in the US I still find it surreal that they're casually carrying loaded guns. Shits bizzare
@IIJERiiCHOII after this match I'm about to quit streaming and sign for an MLS team the bar seems nice and low. 
@W_Enav Can't download the game though which sucks!
Wanted to play CubeWorld on stream today as Benji has never played but the store to buy it no longer exists!?
@dexbonus: Sam put together a lunch for me and I left it at home my regret is SEVERE
@itmeJP: @Strippin @dexbonus lemme tell you a story about a happily married couple and a short little home wrecker named Brooke
@itmeJP: @Strippin @dexbonus lemme tell you a story about a happily married couple and a short little home wrecker named Brooke
@itmeJP @dexbonus People write all your stories for you dude she's helping your economy
My office reeks of Nail polish remover and I have no idea why because I'm the only one here. Wtf
Dreams I was being burnt alive in an oven woke up and realise no, I'm just in LA
@Pokketsays @itmeJP @aureylian @AnneMunition I'm fucking dying I'll be dead before you guys even get here.
@summit1g Yeah that's why I haven't touched it. Gonna watch your shit tier aiming today might pick it up
@summit1g Yo is Shattered Skies worth trying out?
Happy birthday @SlyFoxHound you sexy son of a bitch
@The_T I'm wearing a blizzard shirt. What the hell happened to us.
Honestly people bitching that Youtubes new ToS changes addressing bullying are going to stifle creativity never had any to begin with.
@InTheLittleWood Yeah. They saw you had a cool take on a co-op franchise and nicked it.
@InTheLittleWood There's honestly no way in my eyes a minecraft youtuber wouldn't have known you had a series in that format.
I never tweet about anime by this weeks My Hero Academia got me hype as fuck. All Might is the fucking best.
@itmeJP What the fuck was that link learn to internet JP god damn that Vive made you weak
Sorry I haven't streamed for a couple of days guys, moving into my office + other things. Hopefully next week I'll have a proper schedule :)
@BethaneyMars They've all been Horde males at some point. I tend to flip flop haha.
Just got back into WoW and saw some players ride past me on a Yak and a Mammoth. This is now all I want...
@thatsnotmylamp I think it was an awesome single player experience. If you like the first one it's definitely a good buy.
Just beat the Mirrors Edge: Catalyst campaign, I really enjoyed it.
@AtomicMari @Jack_Septic_Eye @PlayOverwatch God yes
@Jack_Septic_Eye @PlayOverwatch You are a living breathing junkrat my friend
I'm genuinely distressed by it I can't find the answer I seek
Just closed my eyes for a moment of clarity and instead just imagined a huge noisy fart. nnwhy.
Walk into the kitchen like 'Honey what are you cooking it smells great'nnTurns out it was only oil in the pan, curse my british Fry up nose.
Just saw @mordhaugame for the first time, looks like it'll be so much fun.
Maybe those people can spend more time appreciating the awesome female protagonists announced at this years E3 instead.
I literally cannot fathom why people are mad that Link - a blank slate character in an established franchise didn't swap genitals.
@therealzef literally the dumbest shit like a blank slate character is going to be less of a blank slate with different genitals
Pokemons original composer Junichi Masuda came out on stage to conduct the final piece man that was legit. #PokemonSymphony
@CrikMaster they ended with 'Gotta catch em all' and the whole crowd was singing it was nuts
@CrikMaster nah they just went through black/white and x/y it was dope though

Any of you @PlayOverwatch Genji players want my number just ask. Y'all are on my ass so much we might as well be dating. #MercyProblems
Who's going to the Twitch party tonight? I need convincing before I leave my Man Cave.
Im very excited for Sun and Moon but out of nowhere the Nintendo conference cast 'Sleep Powder' on me and I missed most of it. So. Boring.
@therealzef I'm just struggling with them talking to me like I'm a fucking 3 year old.
@CohhCarnage: #E32016 was huge fun! Thank you @Twitch for the content @Itmejp for the host ( with @towelthetank, @dexbonus and; @Strippin) an
@GoldenboyFTW I'll keep my eyes on the sea for the inevitable Captain Goldenboy
@GoldenboyFTW It was up there for me, been looking forward too it since the last E3, kinda sad we didn't see more!
Honestly @ForHonorGame has been the game of the show so far for me but let's see what Sony come up with.
If i wanted to watch the conference from the back row I would've attended
GO FULL SCREEN YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKS I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR LIGHTS @Xbox
@GloriaVictisMMO Hey guys mind if I slip in those DMs?
Someone recently tweeted me a game that had come out with good RP potential in a medieval setting and I forgot what it was help.
@therealcliffyb @lawbreakers send it over I got this
@itmeJP: Coverage starts in about 1hr40m #DFE3
@Elizasoul80: I don't know why these shootings keep happening, we've tried literally nothing.
E3 coverage starts in around 2 hours with @itmeJP @CohhCarnage @dexbonus and @towelthetank - see you then!
@The_T: Hey guys! Can you gofundme to visit @Strippin when he is back in the UK? It'll be about 40 quid on the train. Cheers
Just got back to LA. See you guys tomorrow for some E3 coverage!
@pokelawls @markiplier You better not be calling no one else boss except my Mercy, poke
@Pokketsays @WishfuiiyTV @SelvekTV I think she means Honey potting
The world would be a less awkward place without you @CryWasTaken and that's lame. Get some health insurance bro
@Onision @therealzef as such I limit my personal opinions on Twitter, you could probably learn a thing or two about that mate.
@therealzef @Onision he's got Munchausen Syndrome if anything.
@leilaidrissova @kristenhazard you are reaper Leila
Basically I stopped playing Overwatch at home to visit @Twitch and play Overwatch...?
The @Twitch offices are pretty dope. Got the tour from @ThePlutooo , got stalked by @djWHEAT and am now playing Overwatch and Boardgames
@itmeJP @towelthetank @dexbonus @CohhCarnage welcome to the cool kids club my man!
@itmeJP: . @towelthetank will be joining the #DFE3 crew on Sunday/Monday ! @dexbonus @Strippin @CohhCarnage
@juiceDoom @Egaz92 why is Sicillian an option when Chicago deep dish is just the American version of Sicillian pizza...
I don't get it there's hundreds of broadcasters that would just help for free to make sure something like this runs smoothly
When @PlayOverwatch and @Adobe don't just ask a broadcaster to help with the twitch art competition and it's just a live shit show...
@JustinWong @Twitch @dexbonus nn gimme twitch merch or else
Visiting @Twitch today for the first time with @dexbonus I am hyped
@jasonmaestas @MrErnestLe @ShannonZKiller look if you haven't seen Miami Connection that's on you

@TheJoefudge91 @GameWithMeTV @HappySickness @arkjeremy the struggle is so fucking real
@aureylian @itmeJP @cinnamontoastk I was trying to protect you from the YouTube horde damnit
@dexbonus: .@Strippin @htcvive omfg I literally laughed at him and then when it was my turn I did the exact same thing wtf
Playing the @htcvive and I went to lean on a desk in the VR and ate shit because it wasn't a real desk
@Alucasan @warcraftmovie no they were pretty high and I enjoyed it a lot
@thejustinflynn @GoldenboyFTW yeah probably just over an hour in traffic
@Andy_Lunique @LIRIK he's like jack sparrows dad all mysterious
@TMcTit @thelittlefenfox they pay their footballers tens of thousands of pounds a week each?
@FuturemanGaming @Andy_Lunique @LIRIK I know. It will become my life. We must set sail captain future
@TMcTit @thelittlefenfox uhh... Last year utd was valued at 1.2bn so definitely not haha
@LIRIK I just want to loot and plunder dude. And maybe sail. And kill people
@OMGitsfirefoxx @warcraftmovie I actually loved it?
@aureylian if you think you can get away with using a Rathalos from Monster Hunter on your Dark Souls thumbnail I'm gonna report your video
@aureylian are you trolling me with this thumbnail?
Gotta keep playing Mercy til I get enough exposure to be signed by the same football club as my brother
FNATIC trying to compete in a bidding war with one of the biggest sports teams on the planet for an Overwatch team. 
My soul is wounded. Food turns to ash in my mouth. Leave me here to die.
If anyone wants to invite @dexbonus and I to a thing please just email me instead 
When you are sad you didn't get invited to the @warcraftmovie premier and it turns out you did but @dexbonus never checks her emails... 
@VRUnicorns hey guys don't suppose I could try out skijump? 
Trying out my friends @htcvive tonight any games you guys can recommend?
@skinnyghost I don't want you to be invisible cos you look rad as fuck and that would be gone from my life.
@ShannonZKiller @Sacriel42 @rocket2guns hahahaha
Like 14 vomit gifs on my timeline in relation to Hilary right now. A+
Shes laughing too much to stop the vine, but the vine is causing the laughter, she's actually paralysed.
Dodger just saw a vine and found it so funny that I found her sobbing with laughter at her desk with the vine on an endless loop.
@itmeJP I had none of the graphics problems people bitched about and thought it was hella fun tbh.
@The_T every time I hear glass break I fear Stone Cold will just show up and wreck my shit
Dodger literally kicks her legs and waves her arms to the intros of the anime she is watching  God help me
Apparently the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 I bought is NOT compatible with Windows 10. Would've been nice to know before I dropped $140 on it.
@KiskaeEU The mic is even lighting up in response to sounds I'm making so I'm legit fucking baffled.
@KiskaeEU Yeah its not even listed, but the drivers are showing up and the Scarlett 2i2 is showing up in my 'plugged in' hardware
@WoWman92 Yeah, on the fourth restart now. Kill me
I've installed all the drivers and the device is being listed under hardware devices, but it refuses to show up in a recording device (mic)
Sorry for the stream delay I'm trying to get the new sound set-up working. Having some trouble.
Logging into Ultima Online for the first time on Atlantis Official, I have no fucking idea what I am doing this is going to be painful
@JonsandmanTv The Stinking Rose. When are we man dating
@aureylian @Dansgaming @dexbonus haha we were just talking about how funny it is when you end sentences in a whisper legit cracking up rn
@Dansgaming next time you are in LA I'm taking you here it's legit
@IainCole It didn't, searched the boxes 100 times over.
@Sacriel42 Just the tea at this point mate, just the tea.
Spent $800 on a new sound for the stream and the mic and the mic stand are different thread sizes I want to literally kill the world.
@MrMoon1000: For anyone upset with the way Frostheave met his end, you being upset means everyone involved did a good job. It made you f
It's just not a Red Wedding unless its a @MrMoon1000 Red Wedding.
@IncredibleOrb I love how only two people knew what it meant and you were one of them.
This is legit cat drama going down right now Sherlock could run train on this bitch any moment
Watson has been hissing at Sherlock all day and he's been ignoring it. Now she won't let him sleep and I want him to just whup her dumb ass
There MIGHT not be any Legend of the One Bros today as Benji is AWOL but we'll be streaming Total War: Warhammer with @itmeJP later!
@Darchon_ For some people it's harder to take the L with dignity I guess! haha
Had a blast playing Overwatch with @itmeJP and co tonight. Nuff love to JPs chat.
I hate to admit it but I kind of missed @JesseCox constant Salty Overwatch tweeting whilst he was travelling. #BalanceIsRestored
@Timmac_ @djWHEAT @Twitch @PlayOverwatch look anyone who wants to pay for the second PC step right up!
@itmeJP Yo that matress company did NOT want you advertising that 30% they made it happen
If you are a @Twitch broadcaster using Xsplit, there is a bug currently that will cause @PlayOverwatch to constantly crash, so switch to OBS
@TheRealOctopimp @bucketoffail @EvilGuacamole gdi
@MathasGames @Dansgaming Dwarves are probably the easiest race, but they are all very different so just pick one and invest in it
@Sinvicta It means having sex Sinvicta holy shit how do you make it through the day
Uh oh just seen the @PlayOverwatch merch store on the Battlenet site goodbye money.
@GassyMexican they didn't dance in the street once Max. Not. Once.
Just watched the movie 'Street Dance' - don't make the same mistake I did.
Sorry guys, it's infuriating when your Internet provider fails at doing the one thing you pay them to do.
I am getting so sick of coming up against double Mcree in Overwatch every. fucking. match.
@tnose14 @BlackLiteAttack Shouldn't have duplicate heroes in Comp OW, problem solved.
To put that in perspective for you the average weight for a cat is 7-8lbs he's 3 times bigger than a normal cat
Took Sherlock to the vet - dude weighs 21 lbs 
@OMGitsfirefoxx @Jack_Septic_Eye @markiplier nude
. @dexbonus "Man don't you think hands are just so cool?"nnMe: "....huh?"
@Joseph_Sterio Yeah agreed. Problem is no one takes the time to line up their tastes with a critic and just uses the top google search
"That movie has mixed reviews" nnThat reviewers opinion is as redundant as my cats. Mine is too, if you think you'll like it go see it! 
That moment you see people leaving a Marvel film during the credits and you know it's a schoolboy rookie move.
Between the fundraising for St.Jude and Scare to Care I'm so immensely proud of the gaming community. Blessed to be a part of it.
@MakeupByAngie @dexbonus I don't why are you so mean 
@AngiViper @ChickfilA guys you gotta get this girl some coupons
Benji is running late so Legend of the OneBros will start in about 30 mins or so!
@ShannonZKiller I'll just buy a black handbag I guess?
@Kiwion: OH AND REPORTS!n"Blackrock Vikings you disgust me"nWelp, this is going to be fun
Lying in bed watching @Peeverson pvp in Dark Souls III so I can get good for tomorrow's stream
@jasonmaestas @aureylian @itmeJP Lmfao this conversation
Lying in bed and I can hear the guy living above me watching Dragonball Z we are now bros he just doesn't know it yet.
@UnknownStr4ng3r If you want to give back to your viewers you put the effort in you don't just throw money at them its so fucking lazy bro
@GameWithMeTV @TheJoefudge91 @Kiwion I was more referring to your awful parking
@GameWithMeTV @TheJoefudge91 @Kiwion You nearly ruined us
Streamers giving money away for viewers is literally the most disgusting practice.
@ODgreen94 Yeah I'll do a highlights showreel thing as we progress

@itmeJP @Razer @JINX @PlayOverwatch You deserve it bro. Good fucking jorb
I had a bunch of Vaccinations yesterday and I'm feeling pretty shitty (pretty and shitty) so MIGHT not stream today but I'll let you know!
I am sorry future spawn but your college fund is now being spent later today when I open 100 Overwatch cases on stream.
I'm done with you apple auto correcting my O's to I's you Overwatch hating sissy boys
@_OurMine_ @sampepper keep that shit man 
Light a candle and pour one out for the Overwatch newbies.
Just dawning on me that all the FPS and Overwatch closed beta pros will be 0 mmr at launch taking no prisoners. It's gonna be a massacre.
@itmeJP thanks for the compliment friend looking forward to us playing together at launch oh wait you got a 6-man without me I'm not salty.
@itmeJP itmejpLEWD is my go-to emote for the foreseeable future
It looks like @JesseCox is more evil than anyone could have imagined and stood us up for Balance of Power.
@kaitly_n I'll toss you a few follars to buy a half decent outfit, rebel scum. B'el Sah out.
@RealRollPlay: see you all tomorrow for @RealRollPlay Balance of Power 1PM Eastern WAR BOYZ OUT
@GassyMexican @aureylian @VidCon it's those brittle bones man just a handshake could kill max

@BikeManStream Only just saw your donation from last night! Thanks so much dude!
Thanks for all the love tonight guys. See you tomorrow for more Total War with JP!
Taking it easy after my medical today but might stream this evening with JP. I'll let you guys know!
@CA_Dogbert @itmeJP James you are so damn handsome has anyone ever mentioned that.
@SkyWilliams I did this maybe 10 times yesterday
@Battleborn No ability to tone down fx on screen? :'(
@CrikMaster  Praise the Chozon Won 
@itmeJP America is bullshit and if that Doctor thinks he's getting remotely near my asshole he's gonna lose an arm.
Wow. People are being harrassed for choosing not to see the new Ghostbusters because it looks crap. Tone your agendas down people.
@itmeJP @IIJERiiCHOII I mean he's a straight up upgrade I'm not even offended
@BrownCoatCaptn: Still going strong will be streaming for the rest of the afternoon, come stop by working on @Strippin and @dexbonus htt
@TheJoefudge91 To be fair your dad was a huge fucking troll mate
Watching my old DayZ videos and laughing my ass off. I gotta find that spark again.
Fuckin @MrMoon1000 tries to show his stream how to play 'russian roulette' in DayZ and just domes himself by accident. 11/10
Stream today is going to be delayed because something in my set-up is producing a burning smell and I can't figure out what
It literally made me not hate Gengi anymore (for now) god damnit
@thehouseholdtv: Everyone please welcome @WishfuiiyTV @Strippin and @Timmac_ to the Household!!
@LIRIK I tune into your stream and you immediately wipe out your whole team in squad with a grenade. Hahaha
I am in constant negotiations with @dexbonus over the temperature of the AC it's like a never ending struggle
@JesseCox @kristenhazard @toasterwoman I DIDNT KNOW WHAT EITHER WHAAAT
Shout out to the viewers who are cool as a cucumber, but to those of you who just set out to ruin my day you nailed it. Good job.
Probably the first time in my life I'll say that Twitch chat legitimately broke me today,n my own stream and then later on a friends.
@itmeJP Come try battleborn with me and @gmart711
As a reminder this weekend is a tabletop fest with West Marches tomorrow at 3pm EST and on Sunday its Balance of Power at 8pm EST!
The doc asked @dexbonus if she had any children and she was sat there in a cat sweater with cat socks on and PJ pants. Cat mom personified 
If I don't make it to the stream at 1pm PST she killed me IRL
Dodger isn't allowed coffee so I'm just slurping it loudly in front of her it's like eating sweets in front of a child
@paradoxiq @gibgib why is this in my feed aaaaaaah

im getting a tattoo with 49 pieces to it. i dont ever want to forget how this week made me feel. the anger, sadness, togetherness, any of it
@shelbylanpheare you're right, guns don't kill people. people like u advocating to let people who kill people get access to guns kill people
@samlansky: Being a pop star whose success was built on the backs of gay men and then having nothing to say when we are massacred is not
make the homophobes as scared of us as they make the closeted kids feel.
im the nicest person ever but dont get me wrong i will drag u to hell and back when u need it.
i mean, instead of using a massacre to promote your youtube and; asking kids to rt your video for a dm you could just dm them. but do you 
So strange how @macklemore made all that LGBT money but has absolutely nothing to say this week 
if ur parents don't accept u or love u then i am ur new mother and ur new father ur old ones don't exist anymore i just adopted u
a few kids saying their homophobic pastors called the shooting a blessing. Plz dm me names, videos, anything you have. I'll out them 4 u 
@zachheltzel: I like my women how I like my coffee: kind of.
my christian, pastor's wife, mother just shared my article saying how proud she is. If you don't think times are changing, you are wrong.
@VersaceJonet oh sorry, sarcasm is usually supposed to be funny so i was confused.

my straight roommate just asked me what barebacking is. happy pride!
@lexi4prez hey I don't tell you how much I love and appreciate you enough. Thank you for everything you do, Alexis. You are truly a diamond.
im so angry and fired up i just want everyone to be their gay as fuck selves im so sorry if you cant be. i will be gay as fuck for you.
how do you comfort a kid who tells you they're in a country where they'll be killed for being gay and; you're the only person they've ever told
@embeedub i love you, thank you for being a good mom.
if you're the parent of an lgbt kid and; aren't doing your best to learn, support and; love your child u can go fuck yourself. seriously, fuck u.
im really tired of having to tell kids to stay strong. they shouldn't have to stay strong, or "give it time" for their parents to love them.
im not ignoring any of you I promise. I was up until 5am responding to dms. im gonna sleep for a lil bit and get back to you guys 
literally hundreds of kids have come out to me tonight i am so honored but so sad this is still a thing we have to do. I love you all.
it's so easy to get comfortable and; forget how hard others in the lgbt community have it. I am so sorry.
the fucking outpouring of kids in my dms right now is so heartbreaking I love you all so much you're never alone
if you're a closeted kid please do not ever hesitate to dm me if you ever need to talk. my dms are always open to anyone. im here.
@translatorbentz im sorry  I love you.
@BRANDONWARDELL: every republican pretending not 2 be homophobic today so they can be racist n also not acknowledge gun control
