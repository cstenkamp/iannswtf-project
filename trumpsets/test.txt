mines = shit map <comma> mines in tier 10 = completely broken <comma> mines in tier 10 with arty = kill me now <dot> whos idea was it to put that in high tier
pretty sure even apexis grinding is more fun then these missions <dot> datreference <question> 
you'll be please to know <comma> that i would have had medium missions 15 if i didnt fucking bounce a 50b twice in the turret with fullaim fuckrng
whelp <comma> here i am <comma> trying to do the worlds most rng missions in my off stream time for world of tanks <dot> sigh <dot> such bad design <dot>

@thedarkem the up north part is 100% worse then the old school one tho <dot> atleast city and other parts got some improvements <dot> north=fucked
@thedarkem they can just swoop in from north is what i meant <dot> 
@thedarkem well yes <comma> but then you get flanked by the unspotted tanks up north <dot> also <comma> some tanks need some kind of hull down position
that does not make any sense <dot> if you go there <comma> itsdice roll between arty <comma> if you dont go there <comma> you get flanked hard <dot> 
@andyinbrum to +2 <dot> but only if the mm has a rough time finding +1 <dot> so at release <comma> it should be less of a issue <dot> 
@andyinbrum jup <comma> they stated that because it was a test and they didnt have enough people playing <comma> if it takes to long <comma> you will be matched

atleast @armoredwarwill put <hyphen> 1/+1 mm into play <dot>

@protohedgehog that is not what i hear <quote> in the field <dot> <quote> what you say will be true when hiring/tenure committees count preprints as precedence <dot> 
@protohedgehog i should correct the previous tweet <hyphen> <hyphen> *biologists* <openBracket> on average <closeBracket> are not prepared to post preprints b/c of competitive fears <dot> 
@protohedgehog mandating preprint submission would cause a massive cessation of submissions <dot> scientists are simply not ready for this shift <dot> 
@protohedgehog you must not be familiar with pre <hyphen> prints <dot> by def they're non <hyphen> peer <hyphen> reviewed <dot> and we appreciate your admiration for our product <dot> 
@protohedgehog therefore <comma> every researcher in any field already has a tool to speed up science that they fail to use <dot> so blaming is complex <dot>

so let is hope it is just a telemetry issue that is keeping everyone in suspense <dot> 
@djsnm some will burn to accelerate forwards relative to the others <comma> and because of orbital mechanics will ultimately orbit slower <dot> 
to spread out along orbit <comma> the satellites will make tiny burns with their station keeping engines to slow down or speed up <dot> 
so now they'll deploy 10 iridium satellites into this orbit <dot> over time they will spread throughout the orbit by small adjustments to period <dot> 
this burn is only 4 seconds <comma> raising apogee to the correct altitude <dot> 
looks like spacex have telemetry back for the 2nd stage <dot> getting ready for final short burn to tune the orbit <dot>
