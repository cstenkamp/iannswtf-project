@cwcrawley well in all reality going back to 2 <dot> 2 or 2 <dot> 4 is the same work <dot> just pita to keep installing #eecms over and over again <dot> 
for all #eecms people waiting for updater 3 we are getting very close <dot> testing takes forever because you have to keep going back to ee 2 <dot> 2
it is so annoying to install 10 copies of #eecms 2 <dot> 2 and try to break them <exclamation> #wastingmylifeaway
@jeremylatham <colon> <dot> @parscale wow updater is super fast <exclamation> very impressive <hyphen> thank you <exclamation> #eecms

@natetronn success is different for everyone <dot> i think the best thing for #eecms is getting as many people as possible using it <dot>

@lancewalley not familiar with it <dot> <dot> but now i am looking <dots> 
@lancewalley but then @rackspace removed it and has promised for years to return it <comma> now with 400 sites i am there b$tch <dots> litterally
@lancewalley @rackspace has a cloud environment with their own cp <dot> there is currently no way to zip <comma> unzip <comma> copy <comma> or move <exclamation> it used to <dots> 
@lancewalley i am close to that range with @rackspace and i do not even get a <quote> let me try to work that out for you <quote> more of the middle finger
@lancewalley my bill @rackspace starts around 150 <dot> <dot> but with my 400 sites on it <comma> it is much more expensive <dot> i expect much better #support
@lancewalley this is the cloud/mosso <dot> you ca not even copy or move a folder and support makes you take 20 minutes to do a cron job @rackspace
@rackspace you should just coin #fanaticalsales instead of #socalled fanatical support <dot> 
@brandonholliday @rackspace you should read my tweets before you get too excited <dot> i am almost #postal
@rackspace i am building a website with a video showing this crap <dot> i am sick of the bait and switch <dot> i have never love/hate something so much
@rackspace to be #honest i have emails from 2009 promising me this <dot> all i have received since is less help from #socalled fanatical support
@rackspace i have been promised the return of a <quote> file manager <quote> for two years <dot> support says they ca not <quote> copy move or delete <quote> for me <exclamation> come on <dot> 
i think i am going to tweet something negative about @rackspace daily until they promise to fix this mess they call #cloud #hopeforchange

if anyone in the #eecms community has an upcoming mls project and wants rets <dot> let is talk <dot> 
@stphnmartin i think it needs some fine tuning before i can make it public <comma> which will be the long term plan <dot> 
@stphnmartin currently i am not offering it for public consumption <dot> we currently built it for rets 1 <dot> 7 and will be a private sell at first

@thedarkem the up north part is 100% worse then the old school one tho <dot> atleast city and other parts got some improvements <dot> north=fucked
@thedarkem they can just swoop in from north is what i meant <dot> 
@thedarkem well yes <comma> but then you get flanked by the unspotted tanks up north <dot> also <comma> some tanks need some kind of hull down position
that does not make any sense <dot> if you go there <comma> itsdice roll between arty <comma> if you dont go there <comma> you get flanked hard <dot> 
@andyinbrum to +2 <dot> but only if the mm has a rough time finding +1 <dot> so at release <comma> it should be less of a issue <dot>

atleast @armoredwarwill put <hyphen> 1/+1 mm into play <dot>

 <dot> @boliermusic exactly my point <comma> you have a lot of tolerance <comma> ex' you can sitll read the words with a lot of tilt <dot> 
 <dot> @boliermusic <dots> and you comp that into your 2d footage <dot> <dot> and voila <dot> 
 <dot> @boliermusic so basically <comma> when you put in a mouse head model for ex <dot> and match to camera <dots> your render will be perspective accurate <dots> 
and optimal view distance is 20' <dots> so <dots> you need to actually project map it properly <dots> even tho its a planar surface
so why do they render content like you are <question> the thing is at least 7' from average 5'5 standing point
anyway <dots> when youre looking at an led wall at an event <dots> youre not looking at an orthographic view head on from screen center point <dots> <dot> 
i just realized something that not a lot of <quote> big led screen in background <quote> content developers dont take into effect for shows <dots> <dot>

@jdolbeer indeed <dots> would be nice <dot> but impossible to tour / logistically and nearly impossible to author 75m at least of content at that res
