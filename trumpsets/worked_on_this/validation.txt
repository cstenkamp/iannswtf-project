@daslob420swag yeah <comma> it is not about helping clinton <comma> it is about improving democracy <dot> <openBracket> even if it is just a little <closeBracket> 
@jaygslater their specific argument is swing states get 7% more federal funds per capita <dot> 
@cpl_b hell to the yes to some sane rcv mechanic <dot> but that would probably require constitutional change and neither major party wants it <dot> 
@clovenlife to be fair <comma> you ca not shift state lines so not sure how you'd gerrymander the electoral college <dot> 
@jaygslater as far as i can tell <comma> there are plenty of urban voters in the swing states <dot>

@admlbaconstraps @stibbons @objectsgame this looks like my kind of thing <dot> 
anyway <comma> i think my point is that there are probably billions of worlds in the elite universe with this kind of error <dot> elitedangerous
so <comma> unless the moon is a recent capture the world should be tidally locked to the moon and have an 8 hour day <dot> /5
but it has a moon with an 8 hour orbit <comma> and the tidal forces from that moon are 40x higher than from the brown dwarf <dot> /4
the world is tidally locked to a brown dwarf <comma> which drives the 6 <dot> 9 day rotation <dot> 3/
but i did the math and i think the rotation rate is wrong and @frontierdev have an error in stellar forge <dot> /2
ancient ruins in elite are on world with 6 <dot> 9 day rotation meaning people visiting at weekends experience night right now <dot> elitedangerous
