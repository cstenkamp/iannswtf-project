some good guessing by @jalopnik <dot> the tesla minibus will be built on a model x chassis <dot> people density potential is surprisingly high <dot>

@chirag use of word <quote> beta <quote> is explicitly so that drivers do not get comfortable <dot> it is not beta software in the standard sense <dot> 
today is nikola tesla is birthday <dot> i hope he likes what we have done in his name <dot> 
working on top secret tesla masterplan <comma> part 2 <dot> hoping to publish later this week <dot> 
@brooklynbrett @leood3 @conleich story was fed to lat and <semicolon> many other media to counter imf $5t/year fossil subsidy study <dot> hey <comma> both have a 5 <exclamation> 
@alansmurray no <comma> you were misleading mostly on your own <comma> but w many copycats <dot> jalopnik just lost it is sense of irony and <semicolon> did not get my tweet <dot> 
@gdoehne @disinformatico @eddy_jahn the google term of self <hyphen> driving would probably be more appropriate then <dot> 
@disinformatico @eddy_jahn in other words <comma> the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert <comma> just as a pilot must remain alert <dot> 
@disinformatico @eddy_jahn tesla tesla autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot <comma> as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert <dot> 
@jacobrossi all publicly known tesla product developments are called out <comma> incl vehicles and batteries <dot> would be odd *not* to include <dot> 
@apple_defense @samabuelsamid exactly <exclamation> i love twitter <dot> 
@alansmurray if you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices <comma> why no articles about 1m+/year deaths from other auto companies <question> 
@alansmurray yes <comma> it was material to you <hyphen> <hyphen> bs article increased your advertising revenue <dot> just was not material to tsla <comma> as shown by market <dot> 
@nickbilton <colon> 1 <dot> 3 million people die a year in car accidents <dot> yet <comma> 1 person dies in a tesla on autopilot and people decry driverless cars
@artem_zin @theaweary radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
@nikolanikolov16 shakespeare <dot> then love <hyphen> devouring death do what he dare <semicolon> nit is enough i may but call her mine <dot> 
@newsycombinator @mashable we have not signed anything for a factory in china
@recode article is misleading to readers <dot> no one is <quote> taking home <quote> anything <dot> in a stock for stock transaction <comma> nothing comes off the table <dot> 
@williamshatner of course <dot> our love will never die <dot> 
@katelynbrock drive units and battery are sealed
if curious abt tswlm car <comma> am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads <dot> just a side project <dot> limited market potential <colon> <closeBracket> 
we *def* do not recommended this <comma> but model s floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time <dot> thrust via wheel rotation <dot> 
as mentioned at the beginning of the year <comma> i am expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year <dot> 2016 is the year of experimentation <dot> 
turns out the landing was not as fast we thought <comma> but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today <dot> maybe hardest impact to date <dot> droneship still ok <dot> 
upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines <dot> probably get there end of year <dot> 
looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines <dot> high g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max <dot> 
ascent phase and <semicolon> satellites look good <comma> but booster rocket had a rud on droneship
@seanmcarroll am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable <dot> arguably <comma> any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will <dot> 
@seanmcarroll life you can talk to is another matter <comma> of course <dot> many <comma> many orders of magnitude less likely <dot> 
@seanmcarroll no way <dot> look at chemotrophs and extremophiles <dot> primitive life is bloody everywhere <dot> highly under the ice on europa imo <dot> 
@spoite @rsmoz hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
@rsmoz that <comma> speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics
and <comma> no <comma> i am not an alien <dots> but i used to be one
@benjaminrphoto @stephenpace yeah <comma> that matches what we have found so far <dot> more likely unhinged than nefarious <dot> 
would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed <dot> q is why <question> 
of greater concern <colon> 37 of 40 suspension complaints to nhtsa were fraudulent <comma> i <dot> e <dot> false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
nhtsa confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the model s suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
@deftechpat that is correct <dot> it was about innovation <dot> 
would like to clarify that tesla is working exclusively with panasonic for model 3 cells <dot> news articles claiming otherwise are incorrect <dot> 
@tedismeiamted @playoverwatch @blizzard_ent pc <comma> of course

@jedbrown5 @renzdimaandal @goetzman @tom_stears exactly
@renzdimaandal @tom_stears it is simulations all the way down
@lessteza control of super powerful ai by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
@mattyteare @karaswisher @waltmossberg @youtube autosteering chutes will be added soon
@iwanttobeanurse sorry to hear that <dot> will take care of this and <semicolon> investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic <dot> 
@dfjsteve very similar <dot> the crush core in the falcon legs is reusable after soft landings <comma> but needs to be replaced after hard <dot> 
crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator <dot> easy to replace <openBracket> if falcon makes it back to port <closeBracket> <dot> 
rocket landing speed was close to design max and <semicolon> used up contingency crush core <comma> hence back and <semicolon> forth motion <dot> prob ok <comma> but some risk of tipping <dot> 
satellite deployed to 91 <comma> 000 km apogee <dot> all looks good <dot> 
@spacex there was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator <dot> probably not a flight risk <comma> but still worth investigating <dot> 
@schaffffff flight 24 is def capable of flying again <comma> but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions <dot> 
@jlgolson no prob <dot> we care about doing what is fair and <semicolon> just <dot> do not always get it right <comma> but intent is always there and <semicolon> we make amends when wrong
@jlgolson per the letter <comma> tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services <comma> so no <dot> 
@jlgolson yes <comma> but it is false of merc news to say that tesla took advantage of low cost labor <dot> we paid $55/hr <dot> that is unequivocal <dot> 
we still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of <comma> but less and <semicolon> less of the merc story appears to be true
@drkevinleung @tesla_canada totally agree <dot> am told this will be fixed by thurs <comma> maybe fri <dot> 
@joshuapinter @juliusvolz full height of falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
falcon heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as falcon 9 <comma> but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads <dot> 
@margotroosevelt only heard about this today <dot> sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels <dot> will investigate and make it right <dot> 
@bittdk better <dot> not there yet <comma> but a solution is likely <dot> 
most recent rocket took max damage <comma> due to v high entry velocity <dot> will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good <dot> 
@r_spacex @reddit will do another ama just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
@jdickerson <colon> seating at breakfast has made me a tesla enthusiast reporter <dot> base on table of owners next to me <comma> the joy from the car is i
@vicentes @teslamotors @tim_stevens @cnet coming soon
@tzepr certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity <dot> the cheering is in good spirit <dot> 
@lukealization max is just 3x merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 merlin <dot> two outer engines shut off before the center does <dot> 
@hansmikael @teslamotors thank goodness all are ok
yeah <comma> this was a three engine landing burn <comma> so triple deceleration of last flight <dot> that is important to minimize gravity losses <dot> 
may need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time <comma> so odds of making it are maybe even <comma> but we should learn a lot either way
tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible <comma> but i'd recommend ordering a model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
filtering particulates from air makes a significant and <semicolon> measurable diff to health <dot> wd like to credit larry page with turning me on to this <dot>

@scottymeuk @dericlew @spaceflightins @phillipcjackson exactly
falcon heavy thrust will be 5 <dot> 1m lbf at liftoff <hyphen> <hyphen> twice any rocket currently flying <dot> it is a beast <dots> 
f9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1 <dot> 71m lbf later this year <dot> it is capable of 1 <dot> 9m lbf in flight <dot> 
@elonmusk f9 leo payload on capabilities page <openBracket> correct figure on main page <closeBracket> should be 22 <comma> 800 kg
@lukealization no cross feed <dot> it would help performance <comma> but is not needed for these numbers <dot> 
@lukealization no physical changes to the engine <dot> this thrust increase is based on delta qual tests <dot> it is just tougher than we thought <dot> 
@elonmusk max performance numbers are for expendable launches <dot> subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload <dot> 
@mattyteare basically current <comma> but higher throttle setting <dot> good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin <dot> 
@phillipcjackson turns out it does not need securing

@mrboylan system scan detected only 0 <dot> 2% of orders with same email and physical address <dot> those have been purged <dot> 
@maya_kazan temporary spike in some areas due to x 3rd row seat recall <dot> should be sorted by june <dot> 
@mrboylan duplicates will be cancelled <dot> max of 2 will be delivered to any one person <dot> only ~5% of orders are 2 <comma> so speculation unlikely <dot> 
@erothenberg simple answer is that there just are not many used teslas available <dot> demand &gt <semicolon> &gt <semicolon> supply <dot> 
@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others <comma> but yes <dot> that is the value of having a pica <hyphen> 3 heat shield with propulsive landing <dot> 
@cardoso it could land on venus no problem <comma> but would last maybe a few hours <dot> tough local environment <dot>

@gatorwass you can do that now with s and x <dot> will be same for 3 <dot> 
@peteehmkay @gerardomarina what is the link to that <question> 
@tapwin no <comma> but we will need to build a factory in europe to serve long <hyphen> term regional demand as fremont reaches max capacity <dot> 
@crackedupcorson will cover whole country hopefully this year
@andersrytter yes <comma> but production awd will be a lot faster
@torvos torque is shifted between front and <semicolon> rear motors every ~ <dot> 01 secs <dot> traction control is way better than a normal awd <dot> digital vs analog <dot> 
model 3 will be rwd <comma> with dual motor awd optional <dot> even rwd will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of tesla drivetrain <dot> 
@zooropa88 @teslamotors superchargers and service centers will cover all of italy later this year
@_only_hawk @michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter definitely
@alandbru @teslamotors should be addressed this year

@hbl_cosmin wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3 <dot> it feels like a spaceship <dot> 
@michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter wo not happen <dot> reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues <dot> 
@scottkelley99 edge and contour refinement are ongoing <dot> even <dot> 1mm matters <dot> 
@_amwolo_ they can <dot> will be great for road trips and camping
@bvalvsracing it will make sense after part 2 of the model 3 unveil
a model 3 order gives you priority in your geography <comma> so <comma> even tho total count is high <comma> ordering early will make a big difference locally <dot> 
in general <comma> product comments <comma> suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
@ryancasburn we always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter <dot> loyalty begets loyalty <dot> 
@snoozethroughf1 there will be an optional tow hitch <dot>

@model3owners they will <dot> we spent a lot of time on those <dot> 
@vicentes roadster <comma> s and x customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3 <dot> they deserve a lot of credit <dot> 
@aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered <comma> but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines

@alyssa_milano hi alyssa <comma> thanks for placing your faith in tesla <dot> i hope you have a great experience with the car <dot> 
definitely going to need to rethink production planning <dots> 
thought it would slow way down today <comma> but model 3 order count is now at 198k <dot> recommend ordering soon <comma> as the wait time is growing rapidly <dot> 
model 3 orders at 180 <comma> 000 in 24 hours <dot> selling price w avg option mix prob $42k <comma> so ~$7 <dot> 5b in a day <dot> future of electric cars looking bright <exclamation>

model 3 orders <comma> whether in store or online <comma> are limited to two per person
incredibly inspired by the interest in model 3 <dot> you wo not be disappointed <dot> also <comma> small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up <dot> 
@rossbin you will see the car very clearly <comma> but some important elements will be added and some will evolve <dot> 
tomorrow is part 1 of the model 3 unveil <dot> part 2 <comma> which takes things to another level <comma> will be closer to production <dot>

@tlkfremont great leg room for 3rd row <comma> rear visibility better <comma> easy storage of long cargo <dot> 
@derekslager @skiesforme yes <comma> it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests <dot> best not to have vented seats w kids though <dot> 
@skiesforme ca not emphasize enough that white is the best interior <dot> also <comma> pick 6 seats unless you really need 7 <dot> 
@skiesforme @teslamotors that said <comma> the white interior is the best <dot> highly recommend <dot>

@chriskreidler @engadget yes <comma> this was done jointly with tesla and radio flyer
more details on model 3 unveil in coming weeks <dot> that is it for now <dot> 
no signature series for model 3 <dot> same reservation amount for all <dot> 
model 3 reservations <openBracket> $1000 down <closeBracket> will be accepted in tesla stores on march 31 and online april 1
should mention that tesla motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie <dot> this was completely independent <dot> 
must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
@benzinga i did not take anyone is car and never would <dot> car was actually allocated to engineering test <openBracket> not by me <closeBracket> and inadvertently sold <dot> 
my best guess for 2016 <colon> ~70% landing success rate <openBracket> so still a few more ruds to go <closeBracket> <comma> then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017
@stunt_penguin @layon_overwhale stage 1 would reach low earth orbit if not hefting a second stage <comma> but payload would be greatly reduced <dot> 
@jimmyvosika actually <comma> did not get environmental approval in time <comma> but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed <dot> 
if speed at stage separation &gt <semicolon> ~6000 km/hr <dot> with a ship <comma> no need to zero out lateral velocity <comma> so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h <dot> 
ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs <dot> just not physically possible to return to launch site
as mentioned before <comma> ship landings are needed for high velocity missions <dot> altitude and <semicolon> distance do not mean much for orbit <dot> all about speed <dot> 
however <comma> that was not what prevented it being good <dot> touchdown speed was ok <comma> but a leg lockout did not latch <comma> so it tipped over after landing <dot> 
definitely harder to land on a ship <dot> similar to an aircraft carrier vs land <colon> much smaller target area <comma> that is also translating and <semicolon> rotating <dot> 
maybe some debris ingestion <dot> engine data looks ok <dot> will borescope tonight <dot> this is one of the outer engines <dot> 
conducted hold <hyphen> down firing of returned falcon rocket <dot> data looks good overall <comma> but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations <dot> 
sad to hear that david bowie died <dot> he was amazing <dot>

my comments in china were not transcribed correctly <dot> tesla will keep making cars and <semicolon> batteries in ca and <semicolon> nv as far into future as i can imagine <dot> 
@jessicatetreau important to set ac to not recirc <openBracket> air exits thru rear <closeBracket> and use the snap in shade <comma> which tesla service can provide

ch4 rapidly decays back to co2 and <semicolon> is absorbed by plants <dot> what matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground oil <comma> gas and <semicolon> coal <dot> 
@hamiltonofiyai intentions are good <comma> but massively overweights ch4 is effect on climate <dot> 
@appleinsider i did not walk back anything <comma> apart from media hype

@avron_p you can mount a rack to the roof via suction cups and still have one falcon door work fine <dot> guaranteed up to 140 mph <dot> 
@stumplahoma @mashable door is larger than opening and acts as an umbrella <dot> upper interior trim has hydrophobic coating <dot> 
@sasatokic @mashable front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are chamfered back
model x bioweapon defense mode definitely filters viruses btw <comma> even the small ones <dot> has hospital operating room level filtering <dot> 
@johnzabroski thanks <comma> that is a great idea <dot> i think we can do that <dot> 
btw <comma> price of model x is actually only $5k more than s <dot> lower cost versions coming later <dot> 
in expendable mode <comma> falcon heavy can send a fully loaded dragon to mars or a light dragon to jupiter is moons <dot> europa mission wd be cool <dot> 
dragon 2 is designed to land on any surface <openBracket> liquid or solid <closeBracket> in the solar system <dot> am glad to see people thinking about applications <exclamation> 
btw <comma> not saying we *should* nuke mars <hyphen> <hyphen> just layin' out a few options

@scottlucasnv lithium deal is not exclusive and <semicolon> has many contingencies <dot> the press on this matter is unwarranted <dot> 
@elonmusk $35k price <comma> unveil in march <comma> preorders start then <dot> 
model 3 <comma> our smaller and lower cost sedan will start production in about 2 years <dot> fully operational gigafactory needed <dot> 
with same options <comma> model x is $5k more than an s due to greater size and <semicolon> body complexity <dot> sig series is fully loaded <comma> hence high price <dot>

that is all we can say with confidence right now <dot> will have more to say following a thorough fault tree analysis <dot> 
there was an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank <dot> data suggests counterintuitive cause <dot> 
falcon 9 experienced a problem shortly before first stage shutdown <dot> will provide more info as soon as we review the data <dot>

@bonnienorman new roadster battery should complete safety validation by end of july <comma> so likely available in august

@aero4real i only invest in companies i help found or to help a friend or a cause <openBracket> no return expected for latter two <closeBracket> 
droneship is fine <dot> no hull breach and repairs are minor <dot> impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion <dot> 
if this works <comma> i am treating myself to a volcano lair <dot> it is time <dot> 
ascent successful <dot> dragon enroute to space station <dot> rocket landed on droneship <comma> but too hard for survival <dot> 
launch window always tight when orbital synch needed <dot> in this case <comma> space station <dot> for earth <hyphen> sun gravity null point <comma> moon was in the way <dot> 
launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud
odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50% <dot> the 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead <dot> 
have asked solarcity if we can do something philanthropic with the ca aqueducts to help the water crisis <dot> investigating
we debated this <comma> but there really is $10k gas saved by most owners over 5 yrs <openBracket> avg ownership period <closeBracket> <dot> since it is true <comma> we are sticking w it <dot>

major new tesla product line <hyphen> <hyphen> not a car <hyphen> <hyphen> will be unveiled at our hawthorne design studio on thurs 8pm <comma> april 30
right move is try both tunnels and flying cars <dot> otherwise <comma> having 2d streets and 3d buildings means bad traffic forever <dot> 
reasons i like tunnels <colon> you still travel in 3d fast <comma> but immune to weather <comma> quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
flying car pros <colon> travel in 3d fast <dot> cons <colon> risk of car falling on head much greater <comma> noisy <comma> grounded in bad weather
contrary to press reports <comma> i am not against flying cars <dot> just said it was important to consider both pros and cons <dot> 
reading look to windward by banks <dot> he is an amazing writer <dot> pantheon level <dot> 
@abealem unfortunately <comma> asimov is books largely illustrate why the three laws do not work
another easter egg will be hidden in the model s code in 2015 <dot> last one took a year to find <dot> next one should be easier <dot> 
@pandoomic just changed them to full public domain
however <comma> when self <hyphen> driving cars become safer than human <hyphen> driven cars <comma> the public may outlaw the latter <dot> hopefully not <dot> 
to be clear <comma> tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be <dot> hopefully <comma> that is obvious <dot> 
battery pack swap is active between sf and la and seems to be working well <dot> supercharging is the future <comma> though <comma> for non <hyphen> commercial traffic <dot> 
neither i nor the company are selling shares <dot> even if we were <comma> i would not do this <dot> it would be wrong <dot> our long term results are what matter <dot>

the ancient egyptians were amazing <comma> but if aliens built the pyramids <comma> they would have left behind a computer or something
the rumor that i am building a spaceship to get back to my home planet mars is totally untrue
btw <comma> please do not mention the pyramids <dot> stacking stone blocks is not evidence of an advanced civilization <dot> 
seems like an opportune moment to bring up the fermi paradox <comma> aka <quote> where are the aliens <question> <quote> really odd that we see no sign of them <dot> 
there is no slowdown of the gigafactory construction underway <comma> as anyone near reno with eyes can verify <dot> it is not subtle <dot> 
upgrades in the works to allow landing for geo missions <colon> thrust +15% <comma> deep cryo oxygen <comma> upper stage tank vol +10%
both satellites deployed on target <dot> now firing their ion thrusters to reach geo station over europe and <semicolon> asia <dot> 
next landing attempt will be 3rd launch from now <dot> tonight is flight and following one will not have enough propellant <dot> 
rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target and <semicolon> nicely vertical <exclamation> high probability of good droneship landing in non <hyphen> stormy weather <dot> 
primary mission on target <dot> spacecraft head towards the sun <exclamation> all good there <dot> 
@daniellockyer we could actually do that <dots> maybe we should

ca not delay any longer <dot> must proceed with primary mission to launch the deep space climate observatory spacecraft <dot> 
mega storm preventing droneship from remaining on station <comma> so rocket will try to land on water <dot> survival probability &lt <semicolon> 1% <dot> 
launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the cape <comma> but dragon still inbound from orbit in 90 mins
extreme wind shear over cape canaveral <dot> feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical <dot> hoping it changes 
prob good though <dot> will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter <openBracket> not needed for launch <comma> but nice to have <closeBracket> <dot> 
air force tracking radar went down <dot> launch postponed to same time tomorrow <dot> 
rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission <dot> almost 2x force and 4x heat <dot> plenty of hydraulic fluid tho <dot> 
launching our 1st deep space mission today <dot> headed to earth <hyphen> sun l1 gravity null point at 1m miles <comma> 4x further than moon <dot> 
p85 acceleration will also improve <comma> but not quite as much
tesla dual motor cars are also all <hyphen> wheel drive <dot> main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow <dot> insane speed was a side effect
tesla p85d 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0 <dot> 1 sec soon via over <hyphen> the <hyphen> air software update to inverter algorithm
final one <colon> anything launched by a railgun <openBracket> if you could ever reach ~ mach 27 <closeBracket> would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
ion thrusters are great <comma> but have extremely tiny force <openBracket> photon thruster even less <closeBracket> <dot> must have more thrust than weight or you do not go up <dot> 
and pls do not ask me about space elevatorsuntil someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge

am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission <dot> you guys rock <exclamation> 
upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid <comma> so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month <dot> 
grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic <comma> but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing <dot> 
did not get good landing/impact video <dot> pitch dark and foggy <dot> will piece it together from telemetry and <dots> actual pieces <dot>

@id_aa_carmack that works for dragon <comma> but hard to do for something long like falcon
@id_aa_carmack no choice <dot> entry velocity too high for a precision landing with n2 thrusters alone <dot> must have aero surfaces for pitch trim <dot> 
@john_gardi using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign and <semicolon> more data <dot> maybe flight 21 <dot>

@westcoastbill thanks bill <exclamation> sure is a great start to 2014 <colon> <closeBracket> 
@olajahr @teslamotors ideally <comma> the s should just hold position when it knows that is what you really want
@bonnienorman @teslamotors @teslamotorsclub merry christmas <exclamation> 
@simonhackett yes <comma> definitely needs a huge amount of battery capacity <dot> ~1/3 of energy produced during day must be stored
rest in peace <comma> nelson mandela <dot> a man both good and great <dot> 
should mention that the battery cells used for this are 200 wh/kg vs 250 for model s <dot> no short term supply constraint <dot> 
restart was good <comma> apogee raised to 80k km <openBracket> 50k miles <closeBracket> <dot> yes <exclamation> <exclamation> <exclamation> 
reached parking orbit <dot> now coasting towards equator <comma> where the upper stage will <comma> if all goes well <comma> restart to raise apogee

@jon_favreau <colon> an amazon drone just flew away with my dog <dot> 
@tierrauniversu it was fixed this weekend <comma> so he should try the test again <dot> 
@tierrauniversu the writer of this article had a problem with his 12v battery <comma> so main pack was constantly charging it <dot> 
@tierrauniversu does not sound right <dot> if it is <comma> we certainly need to fix it <dot> investigating <dots> 
all known rocket anomalies resolved <dot> will spend another day rechecking to be sure <dot> launch attempt tmrw eve w wed as backup <dot> 
the gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump <comma> which produces 7000 horsepower and <semicolon> weighs 160 lbs
engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics <dot> replaced gas generator on engine 9 <openBracket> center <closeBracket> as a precautionary measure <dot> 
abort was caused by oxygen in ground side tea <hyphen> teb <dot> upper stage on separate internal circuit <comma> so does not face same risk <dot> 
rocket engines are healthy <comma> but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day <dot> aiming for mon eve launch <dot> 
@williamshatner will do <dot> probably at least a few days <dot> depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps <dot> 
we called manual abort <dot> better to be paranoid and wrong <dot> bringing rocket down to borescope engines <dots> 
if launch aborts <comma> we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection <comma> so probably a few days before next attempt
increasing helium spin start pressure <dot> probably &lt <semicolon> 50% chance of passing all aborts <comma> but worth a try <dot> countdown resuming <dots> 
launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp <dot> seems ok on closer inspection <dot> cycling countdown <dot>

headed to cape canaveral tomorrow for first @spacex geostationary satellite launch <dot> 
tesla is also extending the model s warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
what makes this incredibly unjust is that the model s to date has the best safety record of any car on the road <openBracket> no injuries or deaths ever <closeBracket> 
why does a tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than 100 <comma> 000 gas car fires that kill 100s of people per year <question>

@robertgaristo <colon> @elonmusk i am a physicist and <semicolon> 97% # seems right rare to find a scientist not convinced by evidence <comma> and <semicolon> ~none think there 
am thinking of doing a movie <quote> sequel <quote> of sorts to thank you for smoking <dot> that was bad co2 for indiv <comma> this for the planet
yeah <comma> climate change should really be considered a centrist issue <comma> as it affects everyone <dot> 
am not suggesting shutting down co2 production <comma> but rather to price in environmental cost and <semicolon> shift to sustainable energy
even if the answer is only on the order of 1% <comma> we should still take immediate action <comma> as there is only one atmosphere <dot> 
right question to ask dyson or others <colon> what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change <question> 
what most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject <dot> that is not the point <dot>

@ponder68 carbon produced by a @spacex rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight <dot> no <comma> we should not be exempt <dot> 
net of gas savings <comma> a tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits <dot> maybe less costly then it first seems <dot> 
yes <comma> am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created <dot> market will then achieve best solution <dot> 
trees are net consumers of co2 <comma> so technically we would pay them money <colon> <closeBracket> 
exactly <dot> seems crazy to risk the co2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway <dot> 
big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases <openBracket> ie consumption <closeBracket> <dot> much better to emphasize the latter <dot> 
@maxmberger the collective wisdom of the market is usually <openBracket> not always <closeBracket> better than the smartest govt regulator <dot>

@grayj_ there should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years <comma> just like we do a census <dot> 
weight of scientific evidence <dot> taxes do not ban a purchase <comma> they just increase cost <dot> am against bans <comma> except in extreme cases <dot> 
exactly <dot> better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome <comma> instead of subsidizing particular solution paths <dot> let market decide <dot> 
perhaps <dot> i am in favor of fair <comma> simple taxes that are neutral on most things <comma> incent good and <semicolon> disincent bad <dot> 
@varung_ belief in climate change is not necessary <dot> even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax <dot>

@fairlightex oh thank god i am struggling here <dot> see you later <exclamation> haha
@fairlightex yeah i feel you <dot> we spoke about it yesterday but post <hyphen> nerf i do not actually think warlord is that good <dot> 
@fairlightex it sounds like your gripe is actually with environmental kills and <semicolon> you're just taking it out on character that excels at them <dot> 
@fairlightex warlords are weak and do not have any chain attacks <comma> also throw into wall stun into heavy take around 45% of his stamina <dot> 
@fairlightex my suggestion would be to play as warlord so you can understand its limitations and how to play against it <dot> 
@fairlightex warlord is not a great duelist to be honest <comma> and their crowd control is strictly defensive <dot> 
@fairlightex i personally think you are confusing the statement 'broken' with 'environmental kill specialist'
@fairlightex had he not countered your grab you would have done the exact same to him though <dots>
