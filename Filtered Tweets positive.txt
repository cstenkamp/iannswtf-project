They say Trump is deranged while sending out Hillary Clinton (brain damage/fainting spells) Nancy Pelosi (senile), Maxine Waters (dementia).
You have the left immigration policy in Europe ravaging their people and; culture and; you have the left nevertrump in America inciting violence.
And in response to the courts ruling to block the travel ban, Trump supporters will be taking to the street to protest and riot...oh wait...
All these Democrats complaining non-stop about Trump's immigration policy stood and cheered when Clinton firmly introduced the same agenda.

If you're afraid Trump will be a dictator, do you think behaving like petulant children and criminals who need dictated is a good idea?
The radical political left has completely abandoned all logic, reality, truth, justice, sensibility and; patriotism. Thus, Donald Trump. MAGA
White pseudo-intellectual liberal Trump protesters: Most ignorant/intolerant people I've met. Blacks/Muslims should denounce their voices.
Think about this. The same media who build up the Kartrashians as idols is the same media tearing down Donald Trump as the bad guy.

Obama orders fatal drone strikes in the middle east: 0 protests.nnTrump issues non-fatal temp travel ban from mid east: protests everywhere.
All the corruption, collusion, lies, crime, treason that has taken place on this planet for decades. All the protesters see is Donald Trump.
It's ridiculous. All the terrible injustices in the world, manifesting over decades, got us to this point. These protesters just see Trump.
All these protesters that we see because of Donald Trump live in a box decorated by CNN.

Trump-phobia is real. What do you do with phobias? SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP.
Reports Russian leaders celebrated Trump's victory; them and rest of sane world, avoiding WWIII is good reason to celebrate. Cheers
The left is obsessing over Putin's agenda, completely ignoring the agenda of Obama, who is their president, dumping refugees all over USA.
Or is Obama so immature he can't stand the fact he said Trump could never win and campaigned for losing Hillary that he makes up excuses?
Obama's legacy could've been: Failed president/total liar/intrinsically treasonousnWhat it appears he wants it to be: WWIII to end all times

@The_JoshTaylor I don't believe Trump has ulterior motives that put other interests ahead of We The People/The Constitution/Our Republic.
BLM chants for dead cops in the street: media praises. @realDonaldTrump mentions 2nd amendment: media demonizes. You see the bias/agenda?
My challenge remains: Ask yourself why you don't like Trump, who's opinion that is and why.
"Trump is a racist" -says the guy who has not employed or empowered anyone one of any race at any time.
"Trump is unfit to be President" - says the guy who has never owned or operated a business, pry even needs help with managing his own life.
"Trump is such an idiot!" -says the guy who can barely manage the 100 dollars in his own bank account.
I've reached a sad turning point. I no longer think about converting the Trump haters, instead making them the butt of my sick ironic jokes.
Every time I get on YouTube or Twitter @realDonaldTrump is live somewhere. Where is @HillaryClinton?
Watching the most recent @realDonaldTrump speech. It saddens me people think he's insane or unfit etc. This man is simply inspired and real.
Since when does @CNN do town halls outside the 2 party platform? Since Donald Trump has threatened the establishment and new world order.
Isn't it funny how establishment Republicans are moving towards Hillary Clinton but grassroots Democrats are going towards Donald Trump.

@JonahNRO @johncardillo @mschlapp @CPAC wasn't @NRO a sponsor before? @Heritage is! They need to boycott this mess
Who going to be the first Christian to boycott CPAC? Come on people, you did it before. You can do it again. You don need CPAC!
@NonsenseEnd Heritage is one. I am president's club member. No more! Done for many reasons. Lying is another. That's a different story
If you give to orgs that support CPAC stop donating to them. Look up their sponsors. I am done with people compromising to be seen.
@michaelianblack: In prison, pedophiles are the lowest of the low. At CPAC, they're the Keynote Speaker.

@Lilkimis1Legend it all happened when Heritage, Eagle Forum, FRC and some other orgs boycotted CPAC.
@Lilkimis1Legend I do believe CPAC was/is on the board of GOProud. Look up Margaret Hoover.
@JosephBCioeJr CPAC hasn been about principles in years.
@JosephBCioeJr maybe they need some preaching at CPAC. Show War Room, or an have altar call.
@JosephBCioeJr CPAC is a show boat. Rubbing shoulder with politicians. I rather have a piece of cake.

@elegancewithin_ @GovChristie @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @POTUS absolutely
@trumpsterMG that's one reason. Mine is that he kicks as and makes no apologies
@trumpsterMG @nypost she will say and do anything to protect and promote herself. Little jail time would probably increase her popularity

@VAHIGAL @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump Bush took us into war!
@VAHIGAL @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump other countries need to pay their part, he will deal right. Israel was treated bad by Obama

@VAHIGAL @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump nope, don't have those, I had a step father, my issue is purely I speak my mind and never back down
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump prayer is always good, for us all
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump but you can get that at health depts for free or based on income.

@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump he's a business man not a lawyer however everything runs through the lawyers, some things battle out
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump the reason was clear, there were so many without papers and were not where they could be vetted
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump I challenge you also to give him a chance.
@VAHIGAL @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump was good advice because I was really pissed but never flipped out like I see people doing, nuts.
@VAHIGAL @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump I have to tell you I have a couple liberal friends they told me to suck it up back then lol I did

@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump people see him in different ways, I know where he is heading us will give jobs back and make things better
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump they need to be changed. Obama put us in a bad spot.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump they do have a rich history it was more open then but has now turned liberal open only, needs open debate
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump I like him but I'm saying just because he pumped for Trump did not buy him favors.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump insurance up so high it's crazy, he had very far left ideas, and that is just not my views.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump first I'm republican and so my base views are conservative, I am against OBAMACARE it has blown my
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump however til all facts are in on it I don't like to guess what went on.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump that's why it was so wrong for that, he was invited, I herd one professor at the school was behind some
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump well that didn't happen, however the riot groups that do that need to be arrested. Peaceful protest are ok
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump diabetes?

@benofbens @Jewelshepard well the football game is boring and you nuts are on Trumps page so your open game.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump really so what, all presidents had some unique style, it's not a big deal.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump are you talking Bible verse?
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump nope, do you see Mayor Julliane in a special spot? And I know I spelled his name wrong.

@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump not in a bubble, and protecting ones way of life is important to me.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump lol it was a joke, a funny, but he did go to military school. It's not required to serve.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump well all these riots are trying to stop people from having the first, like Milo speaking.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump but he did this, working for free for all of us
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump this he did it because he wants better for our country. He could just be enjoying life but he did that s
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump I have worked at every level, and I promise you he really wants the best for us all, he didn't have to do
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump he can handle it, but will always defend himself, media goes after him like crazy.
@DebMannersMaven @realDonaldTrump well I grew up following Trump and was overjoyed he ran and won. Obama has views that are not shared by me
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump well he was a playboy and hustled in business back then, but he has always had a heart.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump well now I know you don't know him at all.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump in poker if your good, you keep people thinking you don't have it, but yet you keep winning
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump you ever play poker?
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump hey we all have something, he didn't get where he's at by faking who he is, I love that.

@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump give my smart ass a break, he is doing exactly what I voted for him to do.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump oh brother, really, he went to military school lol, Mc Cain served and he would suck as president
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump yep, the way it works, American freedom and I love it.
@GraysonJarvi @benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump ooos nope not the case.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump that's how good he is, he pulled people in from everywhere because it's America he cares about

@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump a win is a win and I am happy as a clam.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump we need to keep it that way or there would be a lot of arguments lol
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump hype and spin and drama, it's done.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump he sure was, then he became a Christian and started a new path, he was always a good man.
@DebMannersMaven @lucasrush @realDonaldTrump he was a puppet that liked the sound of his own voice, no he was disconnected from people.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump blah blah blah, in your little option which is a grain of sand in the world.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump oh boooooohooooo that's a liberal thing, he's got this even with all the "resist" crap. No worry
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump and this matters to me how? I don't live to be pleasing to liberals, AT ALL
@bootoons @lucasrush @realDonaldTrump giggle away cupcake 
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump but I do. And it's what I live for a good laugh.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump are you sitting on your high horse in your big boy pants?
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump sorry but you are like white noise and I'm losing interest.
@benofbens @Jewelshepard @realDonaldTrump blah blah blah I am dealing with a few of you at the same time, all with different drama
